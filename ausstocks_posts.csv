2020-06-22	20:17:39	I don't know anyone who has purchased from Kogan. Their main e-commerce site of choice is either Amazon or eBay.	Jaqwan	0
2020-06-22	20:24:45	"oops, I thought you sent a direct message to me. Don't use reddit that often.

Yeah that's my thought too, even though they sign heaps of members, it doesn't mean those members are repeat purchasers."	SpaceShip56	0
2020-06-22	20:28:26	"I think it may be a little overvalued currently , but if you view how the climate of retail is trending, and if Kogan happens to become a big player within the online scene, it could definitely be a good investment.

For me, I wont invest, just because I don't use the company, but I would keep watching it, might be good for the long term."	Jaqwan	0
2020-06-22	20:35:05	"I see, cheers for the response!

I definitely think e-commerce will be big now and in the future but I reckon the ship has sailed for extreme growth in it. It will still grow, but not the crazy amount it has had in the past (say 4-6 years ago).

Will keep thinking about it"	SpaceShip56	0

2020-06-22	08:41:31	For another approach, I bought the HACK ETF  [https://www.betashares.com.au/fund/global-cybersecurity-etf/](https://www.betashares.com.au/fund/global-cybersecurity-etf/) it's performed great and meant I didn't have to worry about picking winners	Jesse2014	0
2020-06-22	15:31:14	"That buyers / sellers count is a bit dubious, in that lots of orders come in at the very last second while others get removed, I think it is quite a manliputable thing if you have a lot of money / HFC etc etc.  You could add a measure overtime comparing to the open price (...and other measures as well) to see what is actually a reliable predictor (i believe pearsons r is what you'd use). Volume change of actual sales is good, or price + volume (RSI) as well. 

Another approach that maybe is good is trying to come up with a covid specific value measure (based on whatever) and then screening by that"	PollTick	0

2020-06-22	15:01:36	To be clear, this ETF holds mostly NASDAQ stocks (not sure if any ASX stocks in there?). Crowdstrike, Zscaler, Palo Alto Networks, etc.  Nasdaq is the home of most quality cybersecurity firms.  Would 100% put my money in this ETF rather than Aus cyber firms.  Expect it to have average annual returns of around 20% the next 10 years.	asx_hunter	0

2020-06-22	14:57:58	I'd say anything above 0.50% is high fees. For comparison, Vanguard ASX ETF is 0.10% [https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8205/?overview](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8205/?overview) Doesn't sound like much of a difference, but you're talking $67 vs $10 per 10k invested.

2020-06-22	17:26:52	"hah, fked if I know, I am a beginner as well!

I think getting it via API and doing stuff in python is the way to go, getting the data is hard though unless you pay, and I am not sure which is the best paid option.  (there is lots of data available, but it is close of day / unreliable etc etc), ideally you want *real* time info, to the extent that having your PC hosted at the exchange gives a measuable difference.

i just started this course (python for financial analysis and algorithmic trading) on udemy, it was like $10 on special, not sure what it is now. I have been doing things in a different python setup though so have to swap to what they are using.

there are stock screeners out there as well, this one was good until recently because they messed up the code and you could see full results without paying (they fixed it though)

2020-06-22	20:03:12	So you would rather 8% return (after fees) p.a with 0.10% fees over 20% return (after fees) p.a with 0.67% fees? You should ask your wife’s boyfriend to teach you some maths because you’re missing out on some tendies.	ad69r	0

Yes their financials last FY were shocking, but have a look at their guidance this year, as well as their quarterly reports. 

They signed 5m + in February alone this year, which is almost as much as they made for the entire year last year."	333Tips	0

2020-06-21	20:07:44	"As another poster said, buy the rumour and sell the news. People who are following the stocks know, for example, that drill results are due. They'll either be optimistic (driving the price up before the news comes out) or not, and when the news comes out it'll either confirm the positive results (allowing holders to sell and lock in the profits while latecomers see the positive news and buy), or be a disappointment (and crash the price). Either way you want in before the news and out on news day, unless you're holding long (which is the smarter way to invest).

The reason stocks go down when dividends are announced/locked in is relatively simple. If a share is worth $10 and it then pays $1 in dividends, for example, when the $1 dividend is locked in the share is now only worth $9 ($9 share price + $1 dividend = $10). The date that dividends are announced and locked in happens before they're distributed, so if you sell on that date you get your $1 dividend and (hopefully) a price above $9 (making the value more than $10), then can rebuy when the price inevitably drops to $9 (before building back up to $10 pre-dividend and repeating).

The short version is that if the news is out, you're already too late. By that point you're actually investing for the next lot of news which could be good or bad."	ZephkielAU	0

2020-06-21	17:06:36	I'm still very new to this, it's definitely way overpriced at the moment however they have a diversified portfolio with [GOG.com](https://GOG.com). They have a bigger valuation then Polands largest bank hahaha. The high value is most likely based on anticipation of Cyberpunks release and continued sales of Witcher 3. Short/Medium term I worry a possibility of Red Dead Redemption 2's release and the gradual fall of Take Twos price, however long term they regained. Definitely high risk.	deadasdiscomusic	0
2020-06-21	19:27:08	I meant previous game releases; Witcher 3 took a while for it to build up as big of a product as it did, and its still selling units today. Cyberpunk 2077 preorders will be significantly higher then Witcher 3 as the company grew in popularity after Witcher 3 was released, and it's highly anticipated. As of April 2020, Witcher 3 sales topped 28 million, with 6 million sales in 2019. Its best year since 2015.	deadasdiscomusic	0

2020-06-20	22:49:41	Their cash burn is large, currently operating at 5-10% of their pre covid revenue and that will not be increasing anytime soon as international travel is off the table at least until 2021. Wait until EOFY for updated balance sheet numbers, there might be a good opportunity to buy if the SP drops for a long term hold and if they don’t go into receivership.	Iuvenesco	0

2020-06-21	01:56:34	"Yes but going from 200+ mil per month to that 65 has given them 12 months breathing room of no profits.  I can agree it's all risk you don't know what happens in house you have to have faith and believe they will come out the other end in tact.

Travel will resume,  domestic commercial and business travel will help keep them afloat, then hopefully the NZ bubble this year it will be a slow slog but I have faith in Skroo.

Im a big dividend guy and if they return to about half the eps I'm getting roughly a 16% roi a yr. To me that's pretty hard to beat."	pepperz2jz	0

2020-06-21	02:27:49	Auckland Airport (AIA) is fairly solid too. They used to have an equity stake in North Queensland Airports (Cairns and Mackay?) to focus on local matters - 3.5% dividend yield or so, solid capital growth over the mid to long term, and they have an S&P A- credit rating issued in the last week.

2020-06-21	05:03:12	Thats actually a common misunderstanding. I don't know the full details but the debt they owe is to themselves. This messes up their balance sheet, making them seem worse than they actually are.

Orders are filled when there is a suitable order on the other side of the equation."	BadarZ	0
2020-06-20	20:55:54	Can you clarify what you mean?	senrixey	0
2020-06-20	20:59:35	"Buyers are matched to sellers by the ASX. 
Say there is a seller for ABC @ $100 for 100 shares. 
You put in a limit order to buy 100 ABC @ $100, your order will go through. Whether it’s market or limit doesn’t make a difference in terms of priority if the offer price is the same. You could place a limit order at $99 and hope for someone to sell at $99 but your order may not get filled. A market order is placed at market price so is much more likely to get filled."	BadarZ	0
2020-06-20	21:04:02	To keep it simple, say I was the only one by 9:59am who put in an order to buy 100 ABC @ $100. And I can see there is also a seller matching to sell 100 ABC @100. I assume I will get the stock since I put it there first. The market opens at 10am and I get 1 unit executed @ $100. I see 99 ABC @$100 went to someone else. What happened?	senrixey	0
2020-06-21	19:01:17	Someone would have put a buy in for 99 shares at 101, and jumped your order in the pre-opening phase. They get priority because they have a higher limit buy price, it has nothing to do with when the order was placed.	BudFox2	0
2020-06-20	21:08:44	"Market doesn’t open all at once at 10:00. There is a process and order to it including getting some after market and pre market trades out of the way. 
If we consider the market is fully open and there is 100 shares for sale at $100, you will get it if your order claims them first. There is an element of broker efficiency that comes into how fast your order actually makes it to the market."	BadarZ	0
2020-06-21	19:15:53	"Okay that makes sense.

Say the investor was checking the market depth the whole morning and didn't see any other orders except the buy 100 ABC @ $100 (their own).

Refreshing the website and seeing no limit order at 10am or 10:01am, if a limit order was placed to buy 99 ABC @ $101 the investor checking will not have been able to see the order in the market depth if it order came in at 10:02 and executed straight away? Is that correct?

I'm only referring to the market depth here, I know it will show up in the course of sales later."	senrixey	0
2020-06-20	21:10:54	If the order executes at 10:02am why would my broker give priority to someone else who entered their order after me at 10am for 99 ABC @ $100? What kind of efficiency is that?	senrixey	0
2020-06-21	19:51:17	"Typically these kind of ""sniping"" orders won't be placed until seconds before the stock begins trading. That way it gives other traders less time to react. Unless you've got live market depth, there's no way you'd see it. It's a lot more prevalent on illiquid stocks, and those trading at much smaller values, as the benefit between paying say 0.5c or 0.6c for a stock can be very significant."	BudFox2	0

2020-06-20	16:59:12	"""Atleast I didn't sell at a loss"" - The merger might have not gone through, which might have forced you to sell at a loss. The key to these things is knowing if you're comfortable with the loss - or what level of profits you're comfortable with - this will evolve a lot as you trade more and more..

Making $1 on a trade profit is far better than making a loss - if you keep going ""if only I held on longer"" - well great. Let's imagine you bought Wirecard for 90Euros Monday morning at 9am - then it went to 100Euros by Wednesday evening... great... by Thursday 11:30am that would have been 50Euros and Friday lunchtime 25Euros - this was all based on an external event which you can't control..

Long story short - investing / trading can easily go down massively as well as up - if you're banking on ""news"" then you really need to be comfortable with it not going your way.. which can happen more often then not.."	glosoli-	0

 1. Invest 20% of my income every month  
 2. Just buy vanguard ETFs, which ever looks the lowest at the time  
 3. Never sell (don't even look at your portfolio)w

I started in January, and I'm only down 8% today. Mainly because I put all my cash in at the start.

I think of it like an investment property, but with less hassle, you just invest your money in, and one day it'll pay some dividends, and one day it'll be worth something and you can sell it. You don't check the housing market every day when you own an investment property.

IMHO, If you try and pick stocks, you may as well go to the casino.

For every famous millionaire actor/singer/investor story, there are 100k failed/struggling actor/singer/investors. And all the famous ones are there from 90% luck and 10% skill.

Story 1 - a pair of guys started a company out of college, after three years they sold it for 22 million, right before a giant industry crash. 10% skill - 90% luck.

Story 2 - A guy spent 4 years inventing hotmail, 1 month after he released it, hotmail was released. He probably had more skill than story 1 people, but, less luck :(

100% of people that I know of that just bought diversified investments for 30 years straight are rich / happy.

I won't accept myself, I think the company is worth more than that and the market agrees for now; it closed at 92.5c today so why should I accept an offer to sell at 86c? 

Its not hard to understand why the board recommended it though, this is the highest IFN has been for years and they have a shaky history of managing to pay dividends. They don't have confidence they can run the company better than this offer is worth.

Given the share price has risen above the buyout price on the back of this news I'm expecting a bidding war. So I'll wait before accepting anything."	josh__ab	0

2020-06-22	17:43:17	Problem we're faced with in Australia is that the incentives to buy property vs stocks are way too unbalanced. Volatility in stocks at the moment can be credited to new retail investors. The huge returns in the stock market for new retail investors probably comes from a pump and dump strategy rather than an in-depth analysis of the company followed by strategic investing. Once life goes back to normal and people are back at work, less volatility in the stock market will cause all these new retail investors leave the stock market and go back to buying their first property.	sosomoney	0

Property is always viewed as a safe haven and a mark of prestige. 10 houses make you a tycoon, a 10 million dollars stock portfolio makes you a slimy corporate insider who must have cheated to get such wealth.

Learned heaps and still learning, but you gotta have a decent amount of risk appetite and ready to take educated risks, some people are less risk averse than others and if they are good at it they can make a lot of money.

I remember one Monday morning at work, I had an early morning shift before the markets opened and had an overnight position that was huge, I was fairly confident i would make money on the position.

At 9:59am I went from having $18,000 in my account to $90,000 dollars at 10am, closed my position for ~$72,000 profit. Told my boss I had to leave cos I was feeling sick and he was chill so I just slowly walked to my car trying to process what just happened and also so glad to get out of work earlier  hahahah.

Have had my fair share of bad times too, which I think is inevitable, it’s just how you hold up and come back better and more passionate to make money and live that life you wanted if you had a bunch of trades like that going in a year.

Could’ve gone the other way but I was fairly confident.

2020-06-18	20:40:06	BNPL Crash?	bingbingbong88	1
2020-06-19	02:09:13	"Interesting. I think the hypothetical you’ve stated is really quite extreme. BNPL doesn’t really parallel well to your example of the mortgages during the GFC. Mainly as, no point going into to much detail here but the structure, way the risk is allocated and the scale are very different. 

In terms of what could happen though...

For the Afterpay user, if you can’t pay then Afterpay is no longer available to you. Simple as that... they just lock you out. This % of customers who do not pay is around 2%. Noting this 2% is mostly fraud driven. So it’s very low atm. So yeah if everyone stoped paying there would be no Afterpay users. 

For Afterpay as a business if customers defaulted / no longer wanted to pay for their installments / people just stoped using Afterpay full stop... this could be caused by a few things eg:

1. Customers do not see value in using their service anymore. A competitor rises up that is so much better.
2. All of a sudden for some reason nobody has the money to buy things and all payments default. 

In both these cases if they happened for a prolonged period and APT couldnt adapt or reinvent itself then it would most likely go out of business. However, to me both of those options seem extremely unlikely once learn how the business works. You’ve got to think what is it going to take make a large part of 7.3 million users, who like using a service that brings them value and flexibility, to stop making their payments, and their capacity to pay fall so much that they cannot suddenly afford to pay for a shirt. Maybe a sudden apocalypse such as a nuclear war could do it."	taxidriver99	0
2020-06-18	20:52:10	"Most of these lenders (lets call them what they are) only allow you to borrow smallish amounts of money, keep that in mind.

If defaults en masse I can see the following:

\- APT would have cash flow issues and struggle to pay merchants on time

\- If APT stopped paying merchants on time it would take them 48 hours to notice and could stop allowing that as a payment method.  This would be very quick and easy for a merchant to implement.

\- Once merchants APT 'sales' stop, then cash flow issues even worse and they are wiped out.

The question we should be asking is how much $$ there is in this space.  Market place is flooded with BNPL providers because they are easy to setup.  The software isn't complicated, and the business model is not complicated to implement either."	maximiseYourChill	0

2020-06-19	06:28:59	"Just to add... agreed that 2% is quite low, especially when any typical company faces 1.5-2% bad debt or written off accounts receivables.

Microtransactions are seemingly popular too as a business model, where companies are able to extract more from a customer through smaller amounts rather than larger lump sums.  Think free to play video/mobile games.

In the long run IMO, there will be a culling, integration or fading of BNPL. You could compare a similar ecosystem with cryptos where Bitcoin remained king, though others like Ripple, with innovative technologies and high profile partnerships, never quite made it through."	Pineslol	0
2020-06-19	03:22:07	"Re competition between BNPL providers, why would any serious business engage a random BNPL provider? What benefit would it have to them? E.g. Afterpay has a strong brand name and is the biggest in this space. It is known and therefore, a business would benefit by engaging Afterpay as it might attract customers that otherwise would not have enough money to purchase goods. Why would that business opt for a different BNPL provider who nobody has heard about? It wouldn't produce the benefit sought.   


Afterpay makes the overwhelming majority of its revenue from charging the merchants a percentage of the sale. Therefore, defaults en masse wouldn't be much of an issue if they ever did occur, which is doubtful given the safety measures in place to prevent it from happening."	ad69r	0
2020-06-19	13:42:08	"Nonsense. 

There's room for a few, they play in different areas. For example, Afterpay targets younger millenials, around $280 Average Order Value), high volume. Klarna and most of the others play in this pool. You're right that you can't have 10 all fighting for the same market. 

Humm (part of FXL), has an average order value x10 of Afterpay and targets more affluent 30+ with a higher home ownership and more disposable income. I predict they'll be less impacted by job keeper and defaults etc. 

Last time I checked, FXL was the only one actually turning a profit. Full disclosure, I own FXL. DYOR."	user55_84	0

2020-06-19	04:32:59	">BNPL is a gimmick for those who have troubles with money and math or those who can't even get a low limit credit card.

No, actually it is a very attractive payment solution for the many millennials who do not have a credit card. BNPL obviously appeals more to the younger generation than the average boomer. I personally have no issues whatsoever managing my money and i love using Afterpay!! Comparing a bank to BNPL is like comparing FLT to QAN. It doesn't make much sense, if any.   


Consumers pay a quarter of the purchase price upfront. They are only able to use Afterpay for purchases up to $1,000 or so. If a consumer defaults on a payment, they are unable to purchase more items. Afterpay pays the merchant upfront and gets 6% of the purchase price. Considering that the average default rate is approximately <1%, a consumers defaulting is not an issue. The likelihood of defaults occurring on such a scale as to be detrimental would be far fetched and fanciful."	ad69r	0

Banks make money from lending money. BNPL make money from lending money. Don't overthink this."	maximiseYourChill	0
2020-06-19	06:23:29	"Afterpay has a much bigger brand name in this space than any bank in Australia. The only bank even in this space is Comm Bank. Banks will only enter BNPL via partnerships e.g. Comm Bank and Klarna. That isn't going to stop Afterpay lol. 

A bank cannot get customers at point of sale like Afterpay can. It is so easy to make an account with afterpay and make a purchase in minutes at checkout or in store. Merchants will not opt for a Bank facilitated BNPL option because it doesn't have the pull power that Afterpay does. It would require consumers to make an account with that particular bank for it to work and it would be much easier to just Afterpay it. Not to mention that Afterpay is already capitalising on key markets. The banks are a bit late to the party. At most, they will partner up with Afterpay which would be fantastic :')"	ad69r	0
2020-06-20	01:01:39	Not to mention, how heavily regulated banks are. They probably could not work exactly the same way any BNPL works. Sure they can have a partnership, but many stringent laws would be in place in how it would work, e.g. a customer who is bankrupt but somehow can use BNPL - doesn't make sense?	AxonsAU	0

2020-06-18	09:16:38	"As a younger person, you’re already making a good decision on investing— also getting on at a massively discounted price for these companies is a big plus ! Overall, your portfolio does look quite good getting in cheap esp with BHP and ANZ. You’ll definitely see some growth (and dividends) as you turn 18!
I would hold on to WEB until you would make a profit you’re comfortable with or either +>20%. For me personally, I just don’t see much growth in them long term even if they convert into an online business per se. 
I don’t particularly know much of WMI so I can’t really say anything of them.

If you do consider looking for other companies/stock, I would either suggest healthcare sector- making sure to research as some of them can be really risky, or your obvious ETFs- vanguard, beta, etc....

Some healthcare stocks I suggest to have on ur watch list are:
- polynovo- PNV
- medical development international- MVP
- Nanosonics- NAN
- Avita- AVH
- Resmed- RMD
- fisher and Paykel- FPH

And I’m sure you will find more as you do your research."	steveydraws	0
2020-06-18	04:06:29	"Hold BHP and ANZ. Good price for ANZ long term. 
Not sure why or when you entered on WEB at that price....but since you did-hold until 25-30% return. I also have WEB pre-covid.

2020-06-19	13:25:28	"For starters - good on you for being proactive and starting a portfolio at a young age. This will benefit you greatly over the long run.

I will say though - don't ask people on here for specific stocks to purchase, when to sell etc. It really is the blind leading the blind (for the most part). But I've been guilty of this myself.

My advice is to either seek **professional** financial advice, or what I and many others have done, pursue higher education yourself and learn through your mistakes/triumphs by being actively invested and reading. Lots and lots of reading.

But please, do not listen to the financial advice of internet strangers.

2020-06-18	15:01:49	"Nice work, the best suggestion I can give is don't take advice from forums like Reddit or Hotcopper. Most stocks people recommend are dogshit and they themselves don't know how to value companies, or they are trying to pump the price to get other people to buy in. I would recommend listening to podcasts such as Value Investing with Legends, Focused Compounding, Planet Microcap and ValueHive so you can learn about what to look for in specific stocks so making them a safer investment.
WEB may be a bit slow to take off compared to the rest but in the long run you should be fine."	WowVeryJosh	0

2020-06-18	04:10:20	Thanks for the help! Planning on holding BHP and ANZ. With WEB, I definitely missed the prime time to invest and hopped on late, but I trust they will be able to return to their prior price eventually. They say they have cash to last until the end of 2021...	SquashedUnicorn	0
2020-06-18	04:21:46	"I’m gonna be 17 in a few months. I taught myself to code when I was around 13, and starting creating apps a few years ago in an attempt to create a source of passive income through ads / in app purchases on that. Recently I have started creating apps for local businesses, who pay extremely well given my age. Portfolio cost was a bit more than 5k, around 16. I am extremely blessed to be in the position I am. 

Regarding webjet, I missed the prime time to buy it in March, and bought it last week. It’s definitely riskier than BHP or ANZ, but I feel event at 3.95 I can pull a profit post covid. But I definitely got better prices on BHP and ANZ.

Dividends would be great, but I’m still not sure if I’m looking for dividends or growth. Regarding risk though, I think I can definitely take more risk than the average person, as I’m still dependant on my parents, and as annoying as it would be, can still take a loss given my age and situation"	SquashedUnicorn	0

2020-06-18	04:46:29	"Congrats mate!! 

Only reason I dont like webjet is its solely travel and has no physical assets like Sydney airport for example. Tourism not gonna get back up until 2021 atleast so I dont see any rush for webjet, but that's just me.

You could always structure your portfolio 80% growth for a bit of risk and then 20% dividend stocks like qube for example to ensure a bit of a safety net. But once again it's all personal preference and depends on what industries you like (gold, tech, healthcare etc). But I would say hold companies you like and believe in as you're less likely to panic sell. It also makes it easier to stay interested and keep up with companies you like.

Overall congrats on doing so well!

If you finish up with a net capital loss, it can be carried forward to next financial year.  (Note that you are only entering where you have sold shares.  If you have just purchased shares in Company X and haven't sold any of them, then you haven't completed a transaction subject to a capital gain/loss.)

The Feb high was a market cap of approx $1.2bn, market cap now is $830m. So to get back to the same level as the Feb high it would need a share price of about $8 not $10.80. 

ie don't expect it to double from here to get back to where it was. Same goes for all other companies (lots) that went through capital raisings.

Once the government stimulus is fully extinguished and your capital is exhausted, contact your bank about a margin loan, which will allow you to continue trading despite the initial loss of equity. You needn't worry too much about the leverage inherent in a margin loan because the bank will sell your shares if your margin is eroded beyond an acceptable limit, thereby preserving your credit history.

Mortgage deferrals were taken up in droves but a lot of these people CAN afford to pay it they just wanted a break from it for a bit/time to bank up savings in case they needed it.

I am not disagreeing that its worse now but markets are forward looking going on FY2 data. There is nothing to suggest that in 2 years time shit will still be fucked.

>I think the expectation that the future earnings of companies will be unaffected is not reflected by the reality of the situation.

Sure. But like I said there will be winners and losers.
Tech is absolutely booming. Retail and travel is suffering. O&G, resources, healthcare is going on business as usual. 

As I said, some will succeed. Some will fail. You can't paint the market with one broad stroke.

>You could argue that people could have thought that during the GFC....yet it took years for the world economy to recover

The GFC was a different beast though. It highlighted a systemic issue within our financial system and totally destroyed trust within the sector. Corona is exogenous to the financial system so unless it is causing systemic shifts in economic fundamentals (which you can argue it has but I don't think a slight raise in unemployment is a systemic shift)  there is nothing to suggest that things won't return to normal.

> The number of restaurants, pubs, bars, hotels, hospitality businesses and employees affected will be very substantial.

See my point about winners and losers. The fact that pubs are operating at 50% capacity frankly has fuck all to do with how profitable BHP, XRO, RMD etc etc etc will be"	FlimsyDrawing9	0
2020-06-17	15:33:16	"Sorry, but you are wrong. To respond to your points:

 1. If companies won't return to normal profit for 2 years then they shouldn't be valued as they are now...the price at the moment assumes that the world will be back to normal before the end of the year. Which is grossly mistaken IMO. No one is paying top dollar for stocks that have reduced profits for 2 years! 

2. When a recession hits and it effects a significant proportion of the economy (ie businesses and employees) there is a flow on effect. If half of people who work in hospitality are out of work for example for 6 months to a year, that's a good 10-12% unemployment rate in Australia. That reduces consumer spending dramatically. Which in the end reduces the revenue of most businesses. And many of those businesses primarily effected will simply go out of business. Its already happening in places like Europe where they have had severe lockdowns in which they can only very slowly relax social distancing. Have you experienced a recession yourself? It is tough. I lived in the UK in the aftermath of the GFC, it's hard. The economy does not snap back to normal quickly because so many people are out of work and confidence is low.

3. While I agree the GFC was different, I believe it will have a more drastic effect on the world economy. Social distancing will be maintained for a long time (if you disagree with this I encourage you to examine the latest science that models covid infection and spread). I'm an immunologist myself and I work on covid. I still live in the UK and the effect of the virus has been substantial. Australia has done fantastically well to avoid it but the virus will not disappear...to remain covid free Aus will have to limit the majority of people movement until there is a vaccine, so at least a year. The models predict 2nd waves to hit the UK and europe in late summer/early spring.

4. As said above regarding recessions, the unfortunate truth is a global recession drags on all parts of the economy, whether they are directly involved or not. Think of recessions as less money in total in the economy than before, so less to share around. Prices fall."	chuk_norris	0

This is just straight up false. I have a bloomberg terminal and Factset infront of me. Pick any equity report from any sellside  on any company and they are being valued on 2021 and 2022 earnings. Companies are not giving guidance for 2020 so cannot be valued on 2020 earnings. 

>That reduces consumer spending dramatically. Which in the end reduces the revenue of most businesses

Sure,  so retail will be hit. I'm not denying that. But you didn't explain to me how a slowdown in physical retail spending will impact BHP, XRO, RMD, NEA, RIO, etc etc. Their revenue is almost entirely removed from discretionary consumer spending. This is even ignoring the fact that companies like amazon and zoom are straight up more profitable during covid.

2020-06-17	16:06:36	"Let me give you two pieces of advice. 

Never listen to analyst reports or predictions in a volatile environment such as this. Clearly if they can't provide predictions for 2020, how can they provide reliable guidance on 2021 and 2022?!

Don't so easily dismiss the science during this pandemic, it will only hurt you. Go read the models and literature. Not enough investers are, and I include those at the big investment banks. If you don't then how can you make predictions about the future? You and others like you are making predictions based on persumptions that are  ignorant to scientific opinion. If you don't understand the complexity and timeframe of vaccine development then how can you make investment decisions so confidently? Don't rely on media reports...the only promising vaccine IMO so far is one of the Chinese candidates, and it is a long way away. There is a very long road ahead. I'm not saying that I am 100% confident in want will happen. But I do say that the risk of a vaccine taking longer than a year or the virus creating 2nd 3rd waves that shut down economies again is very high...and it would be foolish to not take note of that."	chuk_norris	0

PE > 15, I'm not buying into overhyped shit that relies on $X sales in 2034. Also if it's not even earning money, there's more risk involved.
Companies with average to above-average ROIC and consistently profitable. Ideally price/sales > 10 but the lower the better. 8-15% growth in the company annually is also recommended.
High insider ownership, ideally owner operated. And appropriate salaries for staff. We dont need the CEO getting paid $3M in options that are nearly in the money.
Excess cash used to create value through buy-backs, internal investment or dividends. Dividends are fine if the business is capital light. And on the other side, no capital heavies like the big miners RIO/BHP. And on the same note, it's usually just easier to not go into stocks reliant on commodities because then you have trade/country/additional risk.

Other bridging asset companies are making moves also, Eretheum has joined up with NASDAQ so trading will be run through their platform in years to come. MoneyGram already supports XRP and their DLT platform. Unless these BNPL companies switch to a blockchain DLT platform they'll last as long as DVDs did.

Edit: A good read for anyone wishing to understand how payments work globally and how it may affect Australia

2020-06-16	06:56:04	ZIP was down something like 10-15% early Friday, then recovered back to about -3% after the announcement on a day that was dark red for most. Zip will move with the market, don't stress too much. If I had to guess I would say it's going to hover around 6$ with swings around it. I think Ord Minnet has them at $6.75 at their most recent update. It's an increasingly growing company with a good footing, and I agree with others that it'll reach 10$. I just don't think you can say when that will be within an accuracy of 6 months. Definitely not one to sell at a loss imo.	HussySmurf	0
2020-06-16	17:42:03	Absolutely, was much more confident in ZIP when that was a factor. Not near as confident, anymore.	HussySmurf	0
2020-06-16	17:26:29	Tbh I forgot about FXL until I wrote the very last line. At that point I didn't want to do anymore. From baseline reading though, they've been slow to move on BNPL. But the newish CEO Rebecca James is kicking them into high gear. Their volume was $416m for 1H20 from their BNPL. Although they've got a lot more going on service wise.	HussySmurf	0

2020-06-17	19:28:45	Because, this is intended to be about the smaller players everyone has been posting about. Like I said, if APT was cheaper I'd be onboard, they're clearly in the best position. But at this point I think I'll see a higher % return on some of the others.	HussySmurf	0
2020-06-19	08:32:50	"I've not looked into what the partnership means for them yet. Seen a lot of people thinking this puts the nail in the coffin and that they ""picked the wrong horse"" by not buying into SPT. Afterpay has had an AU market partnership with Mastercard for awhile, and a partnership with Visa for their US market. Flexigroup has a similar partnership for their Bundll product with Mastercard. Latitude also has a partnership with Mastercard to launch their BNPL product. The fact that they cannot yet determine the economic materiality should encourage people to look into it deeper. I think a lot of people just see Splitit + Mastercard and get over-excited. Visa and Mastercard creating partnerships is nothing new.

Having not looked into it, I can't really say how it affects their exposure. If people still have to know who Splitit are, and download their app to use their functionality, then the hard work is still on Splitit. Unless Mastercard somehow advertises and pushes Splitit in an external way, it's difficult to judge with the information provided right now. A lot of these companies have changed quickly in Q2, would be a good idea to update your research across the board once quarterly reports start coming out."	HussySmurf	0
2020-06-19	18:35:14	Not everyone has the same measurement of what short, medium and long-term is. mid-term can be up to 10 years for some. Since this is an emerging sector, and for my own risk, I consider short-term 2 years, mid-term 4-5 and long-term anything over. I think you'll be seeing a clear winner by the 5 year mark, so that's why I stop there.	HussySmurf	0

2020-06-19	03:20:23	Pretty much the only downside I have seen.  I went so far as to setup an account but at the final point of transferring my portfolio from HSBC there was difficulties with paperwork and at the same time I discovered the separate account thing and simply stopped.  Generally when i want to trade it is unexpected (retarded trying to time the market) and I pull money from my savings to spending account (instant) and then place an order straight away.

2020-06-16	21:38:14	"I have been putting a lot of research into them since I started using them recently.

&#x200B;

I see pretty strong evidence that supports them becoming top 3 brokers in the country.

They will almost certainly have a record quarter this quarter which should see them breaking into profit for the first time.

Their product has a number of features that will also see a spike in growth.

They have had a few misadventures that I am not so sure about, the ETF that they offer is costing them more money than it is returning them and there are some inefficiencies in their technology that are costing them money to sort out.  The mobile app isn't the best and costs them too much but they are preparing a new one that solves that problem.

The relationship with OpenMarkets is both a strength and a weakness and you will see from the number of negative comments out there at the moment that IRESS crapping out has a negative impact on the SW brand rather than IRESS which is unfair but something they will have to work through.

At the moment they are the cheapest service but offer a high level of service than their competitors which will allow them to grab enough market share to get them to the top 3 brokers in the country.

Danbradster is the man with the best insight into their performance but I have them as a long term hold with a target price of 90 cents."	Wozar	0
2020-06-16	18:24:53	I wouldn't claim to have a grand analysis on SWF, but I would be thinking about how many more people are likely to invest in the future given low interest rates and also SelfWealth's eventual expansion to US stocks (I think plated for this year)	insane9001	0
2020-06-16	18:01:20	It’s not really changing or innovating anything. Neither is their platform go good. So don’t see any future growth tbh. They might have short term growth because of rise in number of traders recently but other than that, I don’t see anything.	aaykay13	0
2020-06-17	07:20:00	"Mobile app is costing them too much?  


Last quarter was 2 medium months and 1 strong month (March).  This quarter so far I have as 2 strong months, 1 stronger month (June).  Looking like next quarter could be a surprisingly strong one too (continuing on from a strong June), other than this Q being skewed up from EOFY sale, and next Q bring skewed down for the same reason (free trades from EOFY sale).  


If I wasn't holding so much, I'd be considering adding more.  Sure, the instos have driven up the price, but the quarter is ending on a strong note."	danbradster2	0
2020-06-17	07:29:37	They're at around 5-6% market share now, but gaining 25%+ of new and switching traders.  To me, that means they're on a trend from 5-6% toward 25%+.  Right now, I think they're growing at a rate of 0.5%+ market share per month.  They were already growing, but COVID accelerated it rapidly.	danbradster2	0
2020-06-17	07:27:28	"And from what I can tell, SWF is currently driving >50% of OM's trades volume, and maybe now >50% of their revenue.  SWF is gaining a lot of leverage in the relationship.  


As SWF keeps growing market share (maybe in 6 months), I think they'll start approaching 75% of OM's volume.  At that point, you'd think SWF could dictate the terms - reduce their brokerage costs a bit more, or force a partnership (merger with OM would be an appealing business on the ASX - lower cost, stronger competitor to the big brokers).  They'd be able to dictate the terms since SWF would have enough volume to go it alone - if OM lost SWF, their volume would fall 50-75% overnight.  Though going it alone (eg. becoming licensed, or buying out a small licensed parent broker) would be an unwanted headache, but alternatively, they'll have a lot of alternative providers willing to do it for cheaper."	danbradster2	0

2020-06-18	02:18:36	"I’d choose LYC (and did choose them). If they can move forward with their plans in the US and relieve them of their need for rare earths from China it will pay off great. This could take a while though. I’m cautious of the BNPL sector’s crazy growth, of course it has a future and probably a huge one but I’m personally wary of being burnt here. Clearly not the deepest analysis going on here, though. 

The other comments about 500 being too small is correct in my opinion. The brokerage will take a greater gain in SP to cover it."	check_meat	0
2020-06-18	05:30:53	"I agree with everyone else that you should want to minimise brokerage, however when starting out I don't see anything wrong with a minimal parcel just to get your feet wet. Just look at it as a fee to learn what it is all about. 

You shouldn't do it all the time but at the start I can understand. If not, maybe give CommSec Pocket a try.

Also, at the start I would look at some ETFs like VAS/A200 instead of individual companies, but that's just me."	TheseAreTheMillions	0
2020-06-17	03:56:43	"Neither, you'll get stung so hard on brokerage it won't be worth it. 

Save up some more $ and buy a bigger parcel IMO."	akkatracker	0
2020-06-17	04:45:05	"If you spend $500 on a $6 stock with CommSec for instance, you'll get 81 shares ($500 - ($10 brokerage)/$6) = 81. Because of the brokerage fee you are effectively buying those 81 shares at $6.13.

My recommendation is buy at least $1000 worth to diminish the $10 brokerage. If you buy $2000 worth the brokerage is $19.95. $2001+ brokerage is $29.95."	solidice	0

2020-06-15	17:50:57	"In my opinion, the whole BNPL arena is bit overvalued at the moment (considering it’s in its initial stage) it still depends on consumers buying goods and retailers agreeing to pay commission.

Also, banks are tying up with similar services (CommBank + Klarna) which makes it easier for the end consumer in terms of managing payments. 
Besides I’m not sure how the big banks and credit card companies will just let these companies walk them over - most likely there will be an answer from them in the coming future."	SelfishNugget	0

2020-06-15	22:02:56	Well, they compete against visa and MasterCard, only they’re far smaller and don’t have the ubiquitous credit card infrastructure or partnerships or client base, and plan on making money by giving unsecured debt to clients that don’t even qualify for a $2k credit card in the hopes they’ll get paid back. How do you think they’ll go?	algernop3	0
2020-06-15	22:52:49	I don't really believe it's overvalued. Millenials and the younger generation tend to rush to the lastest trend and BNPL fits the bill. Let's take for example, Uber. As far as I know it has never made any profits and yet they are still around because calling a regular cab to pick you up has become old fashioned. I can see credit cards going down that path where they are deemed for people who are old fashioned (= less cool).	cough_potato16	0
2020-06-15	23:49:42	Yes and No depending on your view. My view is yes by any measure it’s overvalued but this does not take into account sentiment. And sentiment is an impossible beast to tame or predict. If you can see no compelling reason to hold than as a disciplined investor you should sell. If you can see a compelling reason to hold and own, then hold. The fact you are asking for opinions is telling me you dont have a clear reason (in your mind at least) to hold. So you are speculating and you might be happy with that.	HecticDyslexic	0
2020-06-16	04:47:59	"The BNPL industry is overheated but it's a new form of credit and thus quite disruptive. As for the price I have some zip but got in relatively early, I'll look to buy some in the short term at the $4.65-$5.15 mark. A lot of their outlook will depend on the US acquisition and I believe they are expanding into the UK (as much as they can) as well. 

With that being said if Zip can eventually expand their ecosystem into banking (they would make a good bank) either through an ADI or with a partnership (see 86400) there could be good opportunities not only to try to compete (as they already are with APT) but also improve the CLV by cross/upsell of product to their customers (loans, accounts etc)."	brittleirony	0
2020-06-16	02:00:34	It very well could be although I do see more people using Zip or other BNPL services as banks are becoming more decisive on who they offer lines of credit to. There is a whole heap of ethics and guidelines that they are now forced to operate within due to the royal commission. Which is why I can see BNPL options continuing to rise in popularity. Especially coming in to Sep when government funding disappears and people are still spending.	flexturtle	0
2020-06-15	20:19:21	"My research suggests the price was bumped up due to diminished available expenditure by consumers hence why the BNPL scheme took off in recent months. However, as retailers have to make cut backs, the fees associated with ZIP will eat into revenue and thus retailers may opt out. My prediction is that ZIP will hover around $4.50-5 for the year. Just my opinion into how I am reading this stock.

I’ve been looking into costs for retailers and already I’ve noticed that many retailers who used to offer free shipping have now bumped this up. Cleaning costs and other obstacles are all going to eat into revenues over the next 1-2 years."	solidice	0

2020-06-15	21:02:53	Thanks. It’s good that some people are here to discuss rather just downvote cause they hold the stocks. Like I said there’s definitely opportunity to make money but the long term viability still has question marks	scottishaggis	0
2020-06-15	16:35:37	That’s an awful credit card you’ve got. Most offer 12-24 months interest free. Just need to make minimum payments which are a fraction of what z1p requires per month	scottishaggis	0
2020-06-15	16:38:54	Yeah let's compare market share of credit cards which have been in US for donkey years. And a brand new alternative which has only come in the past couple years.... how about you do some research and look at afterpays growth rate in the US? Oh wait then youd realise maybe BNPL has a purpose and you're wrong like everyone else is saying.	Tacomaster33	0
2020-06-15	16:55:32	Some will offer 45 days interest free on purchases but not 12 to 24 months unless it's a balance transfer for new customers. Making the minimum repayments doesn't stop you getting charged the interest.	bendalazzi	0
2020-06-15	16:44:22	"Most? Are you serious...

Credit cards often offer a large interest free period on a balance transfer. To get new customers on the books. They don't offer this as the base case for existing customers."	JosephusMillerTime	0
2020-06-15	16:44:47	It appeals to people who can’t get a credit card. Why do those people not get credit cards? the banks don’t think they will pay them back. If those deep pocketed banks avoid them then the plucky startups can scoop them up but at what cost long term?	scottishaggis	0
2020-06-15	17:05:14	"45-55 days in Australia yes but USA offers much better and other major markets like the UK. Then you pay off and move onto the next where you will again receive new customer offers.   

Conveniently not mentioned once but the proponents of BNPL is the massive rewards credit cards offer users. Maybe that’s because BNPL have no such offering.   

Don’t get me wrong there is money to be made in their stocks but is it viable long term? We will have to wait and see. I’m sure the banks are keeping an eye on it and if it works they can wipe out afterpay etc with better terms."	scottishaggis	0
2020-06-15	16:51:31	I don't think the banks have the best idea of who will or won't pay them back and BNPL have systems so you get frozen if you don't pay back one item. Better than a credit card imo. And I think credit cards are a thing of the past	eggwardpenisglands	0
2020-06-15	17:00:00	"You do not think banks have the best idea of who will or won’t or won’t pay them back?

Banks, with decades of payment history, purchase types, employment and income data?

What are you suggesting is the AfterPay (and similar) edge?"	MDInvesting	0
2020-06-15	17:54:01	There is no benefit I've seen in using BNPL over a credit card other than breaking up payments, which would only appeal to people living paycheck to paycheck. Even merchants have to face the high fees of AP/Zip, so there's no benefit to them other than the promise of gaining more customers. Unless they start offering wicked deals I don't see how they're viable longterm, especially since I cant find any benefits now and neither are making a profit.	GammaScorpii	0
2020-06-15	22:22:17	Perhaps in terms of a larger loan, especially a higher limit credit card. But the hoops they demand you jump through to get even a minimum credit card is too much. I agree with the banks that you'd want solid and consistent proof that a person would pay back an ongoing limit of spending. But I think for low level purchasing, or even single transaction loans, people would prefer the BNPL option overall. What BNPL offers is the opportunity to sign up quickly and get the trust for a small loan. It's faster and lower risk, and is presenting as a timely alternative to the banks, which we know have at least a smudged reputation after the royal commission and WBC saga recently.	eggwardpenisglands	0
2020-06-15	21:30:00	Exactly. It’s a fad, an alternative to credit cards which have a bad reputation because dumb people abuse them.	scottishaggis	0
2020-06-15	22:30:17	I agree with you from a merchant perspective, and also that in general, BNPL don't currently offer a huge amount to be *better* than a credit card. But I also think that the generations coming up at the moment prefer the ease and low obligation of BNPL compared to credit cards. In time, as they become larger which I think is only a matter of time, they'll get things like their Qantas points etc too.	eggwardpenisglands	0

2020-06-16	00:53:44	"Hey mate, just chipping in as a tax accountant.

If you're share trading, you will be able to claim some expenses such as a proportion of your mobile phone expenses if you use an investing app, any trading resources, and stationery. May also be able to claim some other things such as newspapers and computer related items (even a laptop) if you use it for share trading. When claiming, make sure to only claim the portion that relates to work, e.g. if you buy a notepad that is half for personal and half for shares, claim 50% of that cost. 

You don't get the cost of the item back, it only reduces your income that your taxed on. Also, make sure to claim the brokerage as part of your buys and sells.

Final note, when valuing your stock at your end, you should be valuing at the lower of cost and market value. So if you bought it a stock for $1 per share for 100 units and it's now $1.10, only put $1000 as your closing stock. If you ever want to stop trading and convert to capital, keep a tally of your cost price. 

Any questions, just let me know, happy to help where I can. Cheers"	FabricofSpaceandTime	0
2020-06-16	01:08:22	You want to get your tax return correct.  No you can't just leave things for next year.  It is not hard to add up dividends - just export your bank statement to Excel and go through it and it should be easy to work out.  If you leave out income, the ATO will send you an amended return as they do data matching.  If you do it once it is a mistake and they won't charge you interest, but if you continue to leave out things they might end up charging you late payment fees and interest.	3rd_in_line	0

2020-06-15	13:25:45	There was a lot of issues on that day and IRESS went down on that day. A lot of people had problems logging into CommSec, SelfWealth etc. orders didn’t fulfil and stop losses didn’t trigger. It was an absolute clusterfuck. Edit: what it basically means in that the backend servers crashed from too much traffic something that shouldn’t happen but it did. So it’s not normal but happened to a lot of people on that day some lost out big.	brokeassmillionaire	0
2020-06-15	17:17:07	/u/brokeassmillionaire has answered what happened on Friday, but the answer to your question is yes. The ASX can cancel your order for a few reasons (corporate actions) and we might automatically do it for other reasons, such as being too far from the market price. Delay your order? No.	SelfWealthAus	0

2020-06-15	18:19:03	"As I understand it, if you're ""over""invested in your own nation's stock market, it means your own finances are tied to the fate of the country you live in. This could be good or bad: if its economy takes a shit or soars you're along for the ride either way. If you're hedged globally, Australia's economy collapsing makes you a bit richer at home, while Australia doing well means you're left behind a little. My crystal ball says betting against Australia right now is probably unwise (though I doubt the difference between VGS and VDHG would be enormous regardless).

There's also franking credits to consider."	9fences	0
2020-06-15	20:07:36	Hrmm I’m so confused if I should stick solely to global etfs in my outside portfolio or stick with VDHG	MQH1	0
2020-06-15	20:37:08	BTW, I had a look at VDHG, it's only 35.7% Australian shares. If your super is also 35% Australian shares, then your total between the two is... Also 35%. So I'm not quite sure your question is phrased correctly, since it sounds like you'd be ok with the 35.7% exposure in VDHG if it weren't for the 35% exposure in your super, as if the two add to make 70%. Unless you very specifically wanted something like a 15-20% exposure?	9fences	0
2020-06-15	20:50:13	"Nah I get that, but what I mean is, is the 35% super considered high exposure to Australia as is.

2020-06-16	00:12:30	"The ASX exposure gets a fund good dividends and franking credits, notwithstanding the current non payment of, or reduced divvies by big banks etc.

VDHG is like a growth super option outside of super with an extremely broad mix of investments."	sloppyrock	0
2020-06-16	04:45:24	"No, 35% aus exposure is not considered high by most australian asset allocation benchmarks. Usually its around 1:1 with an international. Whether thats right or wrong depends on your view of the future opportunites. 

Remember with Aussie index you're generally only holding 200 or 300 companies, versus most in index funds are 1000. Also inside the aussie index the top 10 make up a huge proportion, from memory some 40+% of the asx200. Its a lot more concentrated than most global or int indexes.

When it comes to looking at your super or your personal name, they should each be invested based on what you aim to acheive with those pools, and not necessarily to ""balance eachother out"". Thats my opinion anyway."	frad_darsh	0

I ‘throw’ money at a stock because I hope it will 1. grow sustainably or 2. give me a strong yield.

How can something be undervalued when it has no income and assets just sitting there gathering dust that it can't use as it sinks into debt with no clear idea of when it can utilize those assets again?

Why wouldn't you buy into any number of professional services companies that dropped the same amount and are now back to almost 100% because they were guaranteed a quick recovery?

Not only that but every noob on the share market is buying into airlines and pumping them up artificially  - that's the only reason they made that 30%. Now if you predicted that all the noobs would buy in, then i'd say well done. But that doesn't seem to be your logic."	twentyversions	0

Profit is only profit if you don't have debt - otherwise that profit goes to paying off debt and the cost of maintenance, and does not go into pushing the business forward. But buying into QAN isn't particularly bright, or unique. You could make the same argument about any of the monopoly businesses and banks. If you're going to come back in a year and go 'wow the price rose' that won't be impressive if the rest of the market has also risen and risen more.

No, they aren't. Because they made gains on everything else. There is one stock I bought in a 0.023, it's now at 0.040. I've nearly doubled what I put in. How can one be salty when they've most likely made the same on every other stock they have, or more?

Almost everything has risen at least 30%. I'm confused as to why this doesn't seem to be clicking with you.

Being brave would be not pulling your money out when others did. No one has been fearful about investing in airlines - lots of people have, as they're now being pumped up by people lie you who put money into something with a very base understanding of business."	twentyversions	0

So it seems if I don't sell avh before the switch, then the shares automatically become NASDAQ.

And

"" If the Redomiciliation is implemented, Avita US Shares will be quoted on NASDAQ and **Avita US CDIs will be quoted on the ASX** "".

Lookup what a CDI is but basically nothing will change for you except the number of shares you have (though you will have the same value as before). And you will be able to sell these CDI's on the ASX through self wealth.

2020-06-15	21:25:52	"Interesting picks. Here are my arguments against TLS and XRO in particular.

TLS struggles to innovate in my experience, and is likely going to be left behind in the wake of SD-WAN and the rising use of 'commodity' (i.e. non-business grade) connectivity. I concede that they do have a strong advantage in the mobile sector, but the consolidation of Vodafone and TPG is likely to have an impact on TLS' stranglehold in this area.

XRO has a potentially bright future ahead of it, but my view is that they've boxed themselves into the small business segment, and they're going to struggle greatly to get out of that box with their current offering. Similar to TLS, I think XRO are lacking that innovation factor that's going to carry many companies forward into the next decade."	ingenieurmt	0

2020-06-17	15:31:43	That's a good point. I think the caveat with that is that small business tends to be the most volatile in terms of the number of players. They're definitely more exposed to economic headwinds than larger organisations. I think the next couple of years will be an important measure of just how much that exposure translates into changes to Xero's own books.	ingenieurmt	0

📷by Supplied, [afr.com](http://afr.com/) June 14, 2020 12:27 AM

There's no doubt about Spark being an attractive stock for retirees reliant on dividend income to cover living expenses.

Last month, Spark reconfirmed its guidance for shareholder dividends for 2020 of at least 13.5¢ a share, down from 15¢ last year, and split 7¢ in the first half and at least 6.5¢ in the second.

Management indicated in its results on May 28 that tightening regulatory settings and the need for growth investment would play into the level of the payout beyond that.

""There are still some uncertainties but overall there will still be a solid distribution coming out of Spark – we recognise that's important,"" chief executive Rick Francis said on results day, while noting that Spark's businesses were also moving into a growth phase that would probably see capital reinvested there.

## Three networks

This sits in stark contrast to industry peer AusNet Services which has regained all stock losses since the bull market ended but in early May announced a shock cut to the dividend payout, citing stricter regulatory tariff settings as well as the impact of COVID-19.

Spark Infrastructure owns an $18 billion stake in three electricity distribution networks: CitiPower and Powercor in Victoria – known collectively as Victoria Power Networks (VPN) – and SA Power Networks (SAPN) in South Australia. The company also owns a 15 per cent stake in NSW transmission grid owner TransGrid.

Spark's fiscal outlook hinges on regulatory decisions due to tightly controlled revenue generation and permitted operating and capital expenditure as the former state-owned now largely privatised utilities operate as monopolies in each state.

Goldman Sachs is bullish on Spark as a recent Australian Energy Regulator (AER) decision for the next five-year regulatory period for South Australian Power Networks (SAPN) was broadly in line with expectations.

Goldman expects this decision is likely to remove ""dividend pressure"" and ""bodes well"" for an upcoming decision on the VPN.

The AER decided Spark could generate revenue about $100 million above Goldman's forecast, while operating expenses were in line with Spark's application.

Capital expenditure was only 6 per cent below the application, which is remarkable because in previous resets it was 20 per cent below.

""Importantly it bodes well for the VPN reset process,"" the Goldman Sachs analysts said, due to the ""reduced variance between application and final decision provides confidence that VPN application will be broadly accepted.""

""We believe this reduces the pressure on cutting the dividend, thus our base case is now $0.13 per share.""

## Move into renewables

While Morgan Stanley analyst Rob Koh said the AER decision is unlikely to change dividend per share guidance, he isn't so optimistic about the SAPN decision indicating a rosy outcome for the upcoming VPN decision.

""Resets of SAPN in 2020 and VPN in 2021 will likely mean lower revenue allowances,"" he said.

As the majority of Spark's business running power grids is subject to tight regulatory control and at [times haphazard interventions,](https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/spark-nervous-about-regulatory-settings-for-covid-recovery-20200527-p54wsb) the company is seeking to secure revenue by [expanding into higher growth, less rigidly regulated parts of the electricity sector. ](http://www.afr.com/business/infrastructure/spark-infrastructure-eyes-growth-in-renewables-connections-20170827-gy5cir)

That has driven the move into renewable energy, with [Spark's first investment in this area, the Bomen solar farm in NSW](https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/westpac-commits-to-100pc-renewables-as-it-signs-solar-deal-with-spark-20190417-p51ewn), due to start commercial operations this quarter.

The company views the uncertain and inconsistent policy environment of the [energy transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy as fraught](https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/spark-nervous-about-regulatory-settings-for-covid-recovery-20200527-p54wsb) but if done right it poses a huge business opportunity.

At the Macquarie Australia Conference last month, Spark's chief financial officer Gerard Dover pointed to the need for $11 billion of transmission projects, as well as storage and renewables generation capacity across the electricity market. This included more than $5 billion in NSW, where its part-owned TransGrid expects to play a major role.

Mr Koh agrees Spark's growing ""investment in contracted networks and solar generation"" is an upside risk, but that needs to be balanced with the possibility of ""large acquisition bids in competitive processes""."	voipforfree	0

The service I'm designing parses both twitter and asx announcements, and attempts to gauge automatically the ""sentiment"" behind both these feeds (at this point simply positive or negative, but more complex hopefully in the future if I can make enough money to dedicate myself full time to this).

As per my preference, IG markets and Fx view are really good. They give a tough competition to other brokers. Their trading platforms are very user-friendly and glitch- free. Also, Fx view and IG markets provide the tightest spreads in the industry."	morganedwardsms	0

Until recently you were forced to not touch your super unless you had an extreme need for it (total disability, death).

So yes - they used to tell you how not to spend your money, why would this be any different?

>	You could withdraw super at retirement then pour it into the pokies and be rewarded with a weekly pension for the rest of your life.

YOUR money, this isn’t a reward - you worked your entire life to set up your retirement fund.

What im saying is - a whole lot of people are going to be critically unable to retire thanks to the government allowing people to withdraw their super. These people should feel very let down that the government didn’t step in and help them in their time of need. Instead the government said “well you’re just going to have to raid your retirement fund”."	HeckingLoveDogs	0

Pros for having a lot of companies can include a little more safety if one goes down and it allows for more diversity. 
Cons would be that you'll pay more brokerage, you'll likely have less in each share so if one goes up a lot you aren't maximising your gain and your portfolio will just be more difficult to manage.

Pros and cons for a smaller portfolio is essentially that but in reverse. There's obviously likely more for each but they're the main ones that jump out to me."	GattlingGun1910	0

2020-06-12	00:16:08	"Nothing wrong with it per se, but if you are buying into what you consider ""blue chip"" safe stocks and don't expect much capital growth, why not buy into ETFs instead? At least then your diversified and your capital/dividend is not in as much risk in a single company.

The other thing with this strategy is that you may be over simplifying the ease in ""timing the market"". Let's take for example 2 blue chips: CSL and CBA (please note I know CSL somewhat well as a holder for a few years now, but CBA I'm only looking at the price chart and making interpretations of what I see based on what I recall in those time periods). Also note I'm over simplifying this by not considering what X share price meant as valuation at those points in time, but I would argue a good portion of retail investors don't really understand valuations well enough to use them or use them well.

With CSL, as far as I can recall, it's been ""overvalued"" by traditional measures for at least the past 3 years (PE constantly well above the typical 10-15). After it hit above $230 in Sept 2018, it dropped to $180 through Nov/Dec that year. In 2020 you could call that a fantastic buying opportunity, but at that point in time, the share price had dropped by more than -20%. The kicker is even at $180, it was unprecedently high vs historic prices. Could you have honestly said you would have the courage to buy into this dip that wasn't historically cheap?

With CBA, over the past 3 months it's hovered below $60. That is historically cheap (hasn't been that price for an extended period for almost 8 years). Easy enough to say that's a good time to buy, but the concern at the time was how uncertain COVID-19 was and the potential impact. It could go much further down? Shares can be valued at $0 and lose everything. What happens if I bought at $57 and it goes to $40 (almost -30%). Now it's flirting with the $70. Still historically cheap (it's been mostly between $75-$90 for almost a decade), but the world is in turmoil due to COVID-19, Protests in most of the first world, entering the second half of the Govt support promised in March/April. US and Global markets have started going red again after a bull run. Would you buy now? 

I'm not trying to deter you (although it reads like I am), I'm just trying to say that your approach of buying dips, even if you don't pick the bottom, is much harder to execute in real life because you're not a robot. There'll be some element of fear because real money is at stake.

If you hard commit to something (i.e. invest $X every $Y intervals regardless of what the market is doing) you tend to ride that wave more successfully than loading up when shares are down. They go down for a reason, and sometimes it's because the companies fundmentally changed. I mean a great example of this is Blackmores (BKL). Have a look at their share price chart. I guarantee you in 2015 and definitely 2016 people were thinking it's a safe blue chip. In 2020 I'd say there are few people who'd bet it'll ever hit $200 again.

Also the worst thing that can happen is you lose your entire investment. Companies do collapse, and no company is immune from mismanagement. Dividends aren't guaranteed and yields currently are very skewed because of the discount in share price vs the last time dividends were paid for most companies. There's always an element of risk. 

Your strategy is perfectly fine as long as you do your research. Don't buy something because you think it's safe and historically cheap alone. There could be a fundamental change in business to make it cheap."	Pandos17	0
2020-06-11	21:39:11	It can be possible ATM, will need some luck though. I started trading 5 weeks ago and I've turned 20k into 35k and went long term in that amount of time.	Doomkoon4648	0

2020-06-12	01:23:55	"Really the best thing you can do with this type of strategy is to try it. Say for example you try buying and selling something like BHP that goes up and down but is unlikely to suffer a huge collapse.

Buy $5,000, that's your safe dividend, long term growth parcel. Then take some extra play money, and wait for a market down day. Maybe buy at -3%. If it recovers the next 1-3 days (say +3%), you flip it and add the profit to your trading play money. If it doesn't recover that quickly, it doesn't matter because it just sits with your long term parcel.

You might not make much money for a while, or ever, but it's not going to kill you to try.

I would suggest RFF as an option for this strategy. It trades in a narrow window and is relatively safe, but there's enough up and down days to try and turn a profit."	slothonreddit	0
2020-06-11	21:24:21	"So your strategy is to buy shares that will have high growth in that short and long term and high yield?

That’s genius. Why has no one thought of that?"	Kitty015	0
2020-06-12	00:36:22	"Thanks for your thoughtful response, I appreciate it. I was thinking the same thing about ETF's - I have AFI, MLT, WHF, WAM etc and some seem to be moving up and down a fair bit at the moment so could try it with these too.

That's true, I guess I have to remember there is always a small amount of risk. I have 22 companies at the moment (and some are ETFs) so I'm trying to minimise risk that way. I will probably only try this strategy on about 5 or so at a time (and leave the rest alone as my long term passive income streams). You are right about researching the company and checking the announcements before buying and selling at a particular time too.

I guess what I'm thinking is if I buy because I believe it's dipping, and it continues to fall (will happen some of the time of course) I'm happy to hang on to it for as long as I need (1 week, months, years, decades if I need - very unlikely though) because I don't need the money and it's a safe, blue chip stock with dividends. But what is more likely is that in a volatile time like now, it will have to go up at some stage which is when i sell and make $200 or whatever.

Also with something like Blackmores, I always stay away from retail because it seems too risky to me. CSL is an interesting anomaly. I own just $1000 in them but will leave that for probably 10+ years I think.

Can I ask what you mean by this ""Shares can be valued at $0 and lose everything"" - isn't this only the very worst case scenario? Not likely to happen with the banks, ETFs, solid industrials that have been around since 1990 etc?"	soul_painter_	0
2020-06-11	21:56:12	Wow that's awesome! I agree, definitely need some luck and always depends on what the market does. But it doesn't feel like gambling when you are happy to have the money in there for 10+ years and it's a solid company. Do you mind sharing which companies you've been trading? For example I've been focusing on ones like the banks, FMG, BHP, WPL, ABC, LLC.	soul_painter_	0
2020-06-16	17:36:17	Why don't you think it's worth it? Even if I make a $300 profit on a trade, it goes down to about $190 factoring in everything. An extra nearly $200 every now and again would add up	soul_painter_	0
2020-06-12	02:50:27	"That's exactly what I was thinking, you just explained it better. I might consider using a bigger parcel like $5000 then to make it more worthwhile. I've only been doing little parcels like $1500.

I haven't heard of RFF, without knowing the background of the company, that looks like a good one at least from the graphs. Lots of up and down days lately and a good dividend too. Thanks for the tip :)"	soul_painter_	0
2020-06-11	21:34:32	No, I specified they won't be high growth stocks in the short term or long term because they are safe, blue chip stocks for dividends. Not high yield either, but if I do it regularly the profits could add up.	soul_painter_	0
2020-06-12	00:57:12	"No worries, glad you took it how I intended (just giving my opinion, not to put you down for thinking about it).

With the ones you've listed, those are all LICs (Listed investment companies) I believe, which are companies that are listed on the ASX but exist solely to trade (usually shares). So you are paying someone else (in the form of performance and management fees) to pick stocks for you. I've had mixed results in these myself (held WMI, WGB and AEG at different points in time), and I'm not a big fan of them. 

ETFs are Funds that track/benchmark against something (typically an index) which means they invest in assets (usually shares) to match the performance of that benchmark. They charge management fees, but usually not performance fees as they are an investment vehicle to help you diversify your investments. Vanguards are the most popular I believe, and the most common one you'll come across in Australia is VAS (which is supposed to replicate the ASX 300). So Vanguard will buy shares in proportion to replicate the ASX300 and you own a % of that as a shareholder.

I think what your saying is fair.. through March and April the share market has been at a historical low (at least compared to most of the last decade). I would say you won't get this many chances that often. My original comment was going to talk about the ASX200 and it's historic dips. We haven't seen such a big sudden dip like this in a while. So you won't get many chances like this if that's what you wait for (historically since GFC I can only think of 2011, early 2016 and late 2018 as a ""meaningful"" dip). So I guess if you can define what a big enough dip is in each share for you to buy, that might not be a bad way to look at it? Also you might miss out on prolonged bull runs (that was my biggest mistake, I didn't double down on winners often enough in the last 5 years).

On the shares can be valued at $0. I'm speaking in hyperbole here, and very extreme cases, but companies can go under, and it's not always due to overall market conditions deteriorating for everyone. You've always got capital at risk, so don't invest any more than you can afford to lose. In blue chips it's unlikely to go to zero, but you can definitely get into a permanent loss position (like someone who bought BKL at $200 for example).

Based on what you've said, can I ask why you have 22 holdings? that sounds like it's a lot to manage, and you may end up not getting the diversification benefit you were trying to get after a while (diminishing returns of the benefit of diversification), if for example all of your holdings are ASX companies and their primary business is in Australia."

2020-06-16	17:42:43	I get that, but at the same time just going dividend reinvestment and sticking to your usual investing time table and you end up with maybe a few hundred dollars less at the end of the year with way less effort. And a future of compounding interest.	MrSarcastica	0
2020-06-12	02:58:52	"I understood what you meant because I've thought about trying something similar. I figure if it's already something you plan to hold long term, the risk is manageable because you don't necessarily need to sell if the strategy is not working.

RFF is a Real Estate Investment Trust that is basically a landlord for argicultural land. I have considered trying to trade it because you can kind of predict the max. and min. price range just looking at the long term price chart. And if you get stuck holding, pretty healthy dividend."	slothonreddit	0

2020-06-12	03:07:24	"Ahh they are LICs, woops, not index funds. I never actually understood the difference to be honest so that's really interesting, thanks for explaining the difference. I'm still getting my head around it all. I haven't heard of those LICs you mentioned.

I actually have VGS and VDHG on the ASX, but I bought these before the pandemic so I will be sitting on these for awhile I think, they are still in the red. I might look into VAS for this strategy though so thanks for the tip. (I don't count these in my regular portfolio but I actually bought VEU on the NYSE during the pandemic, but that's a set and forget - not going to worry about any short term buying and selling for the US shares, I more so did that for fun. To see where it's at in 10 years hehe. Also bought Pepsico).

Yeah you're right - this is a historical time for the sharemarket - it's usually not like this. I've been told usually there is hardly any volatility and not many opportunities like there is at the moment. What do you mean by you didn't double down on winners often enough in the last 5 years? Sounds like you were playing it safe which isn't a bad thing I don't think. So many people lose thousands on the share market.

Yeah I have read that I may actually have too many holdings with 22, I've been thinking that might be the case. When I originally bought them all I did lots of research into the company, dividends etc so I was confident they were all good choices. Then during the pandemic I saw lots of bargains so I bought even more. But you're right, it's probably too many for the longer term. That's why I've been thinking about selling a few (like BHP) which are in the green and then focusing on building up the existing ones to hold for the long term, and maybe doing some ""swing trading"" or whatever this is called that I'm talking about haha.

2020-06-11	21:49:22	I think there is opportunity for some growth, I wouldn't say high growth though. That's why it would have to be regular buys and sells over time which I already said in my OP.	soul_painter_	0
2020-06-12	16:14:14	"All good, I'm no expert! Have just been fortunate enough to pick more winners than losers over the years haha.

With the 22 holdings, I think people suggest that it's too many because you'd be paying a lot of brokerage vs having 10 holdings (literally more than half the brokerage in fact). But in my opinion, if you're worried about brokerage on this investment, it's probably not a solid enough one (i.e. if that $10-$20 brokerage is make or break, there's bigger things to worry about in your investment strategy).

2020-06-16	17:48:13	Quick maths says you probably need to do this with $5k to make it worthwhile, or brokerage will swallow any profits. Even still, you're probably only going to make $100 or so at a time, but it's more about testing the theory for now. Plus making a few hundred dollars for 5min worth of effort to set up the buy/sell orders is not too bad anyways. I have to do a lot more at work to make that much.	slothonreddit	0
2020-06-11	23:10:53	"I think their point is that a lot of profit you make trading safe stocks every 2-3 days will be eaten up by brokerage then taxed unless you're moving very large quantities. There's not much difference between day trading and flipping every 2-3 days, if any.

It sounds like you want to make extra money fast but not have any risk by buying ""safe"" stuff. That's not typically how it works. This is going to require you to time the market incredibly well repeatedly to have any hope of it being worth your time.

Godspeed."	Snap111	0
2020-06-16	17:40:02	"Yes that's what I thought - if you're thinking long term then brokerage shouldn't come into it. That's for the long game though, I'm definitely taking it into account with these quick trades I am attempting.

Yes the market is so volatile at the moment, the conditions are perfect really"	soul_painter_	0

2020-06-11	23:46:16	"Haha this ""Kitty"" person obviously thinks I'm a complete idiot which is all good.

I know what you mean, but I don't think it will be making money fast, I just think it may be possible to make small packets consistently over the long run.

For example, last week I bought 40 shares of BHP for $30 per share which = $1200.

Today I sold them for $37 per share.

= $1480

Which = $280, minus $40 brokerage overall which = $240

And if capital gains tax is roughly 30%, lets minus $70 tax which = $170

An extra $170 in my pocket for 0 risk, an outlay of only $1200, and zero effort seems awesome? I just come from no money so this seems amazing to me. I know it depends on what the market does, but if I have 20 safe, solid blue chip stocks going at once in my portfolio which I’m happy to hang on to for 10+ years if I have to, and watch what they do every few days, selling the ones that have are in profit and buying the ones that are low, just seems like it could work in the longer term, that’s all. Or at least while the market is as volatile as it is at the moment."	soul_painter_	0

2020-06-12	04:09:34	"It's definitely a strategy during volatile times. My recommendation would be to have a set of guidelines and make sure you stick to them. If you tell urself you're going to hold stock x until it hits price y, do it.

If you get bored or frustrated with some flat periods (which is what the market traditionally is) and start chasing those small profits (because let's be honest winning feels good and it's addictive), those $40 brokerage amounts will start to add up very quickly.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that in your mind, you need to ensure you maintain your focus on your long term holds. If your priorities morph into repeated small buy/sell wins, you'll be effectively gambling and may fuck yourself rapidly.

The other thing to keep in mind is that you need to research your sell prices and know WHY you're going to sell at that price. Imagine cashing a small profit on afterpay recently expecting to just swing trade it. You're sitting on your couch with your $200 profit while everyone who held is sitting on their couch, on the rocket they stayed on while they survey the moon!

Have fun."	Snap111	0

2020-06-12	14:37:25	To answer question 1 with first hand experience. I hold a couple of LIC’s (Argo and Milton) ETFS VAS and VGS as well as a couple of individual stocks. I purchased the LIC’s and ETF’s in January, then March happened and what I’ve noticed while holding onto all stocks through this time is that the LIC’s seem to hold stronger than the index funds. They did drop but not to the extent of the ETF’s. Good LIC’s are well diversified and also hold cash as part of their defence strategy.	mrburnsknees	0

They run a bunch of player analysis software which is where you get live statistics for AFL, NRL, and Soccer - they cover international sport as well. But with clubs struggling, they may not be utilizing their services for a while (costs about 500k to set up and 50k to manage per year \[heard these stats back in 2014 - not sure if they are like that anymore\]).

Don’t let FOMO rush you into making financial decisions without proper research and understanding of what you are doing. I recommend taking a few months to read the daily posts on this subreddit, r/ausfinance and/or r/fiaustralia to get a general understanding of the topics discussed here, and also look into other resources such as books, podcasts and blogs. You will find lots of recommendations for resources in these forums.

As an nerd and half-assed entrepreneur that basket is sad to look at, Australian tech is pretty damn unimaginative, though I guess we lose a lot of talent to the states.

This was a great deep dive with the CEO [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEtWS2WPoBs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEtWS2WPoBs) 

What i like... 

\- Synthetic graphite makes up the majority of the anode in a EV battery. So \~50% of the battery. By 2030, industry demand for this material will be at least 10x. 

\- NVX patented DPMG process ensures they will be producing best in class graphite (industry highest columbic efficiency rating). It will be highly sought after by EV makers like Tesla as it means they can deliver their 1.6km lifespan battery target.

\- NVX have a plant producing Synthetic graphite in the US, producing material for a 500t contract with Samsung. They plan to ramp to 1000s of tonnes in the future as EV demand grows. 

\- They just raised cash to fund the next 2 years. They also converted all of their convertible bond holders to stock to reduce their future liabilities.

Highly recommended for when a stock keeps rising but you might think it's overvalued. In basic terms if the share price keeps going up your shares don't get sold but if the market turns and the price goes down they'll trigger an automatic sell.	NoKarmaNoDrama	0

2020-06-10	03:59:51	"Franking credits have no bearing on capital gains. Franking credits are simply a way to offset your own tax liability for dividends against tax that has already been paid by the business on their profits. (The goal is to stop double taxation).

Lets say a business makes $100 profit (before tax) that they intend to pay you as a fully franked dividend. They must first pay tax on their profits, company tax rate is 30% so they pay $30 to the ATO and you get $70 + $30 franking credit representative of the tax already paid by the business.

For the next part, lets assume you have a marginal tax rate of 32.5%.... During your tax return, you declare the $70 dividend + $30 franking credit for a total of $100 taxable income (On which you would normally owe tax of $32.50), however the company has already paid $30 tax on those profits, which you then declare to the ATO, and they subtract that amount from the amount of tax you have to pay, meaning you only have to pay $2.50 tax on that dividend.

If you're a low income earner and your marginal tax rate is less than the company tax rate then you actually get a refund for the difference."	Black_Light	0
2020-06-10	03:59:40	"Dividends are treated as income. So the total amount gets added to your income for the year.

Franking means a portion of the tax you would be paying has already been paid by the company, at a rate of 30%. So if MQG is 60% franked, then 60% of the dividend has had 30% tax already paid on it. That tax already paid as treated as credit towards what tax you should be paying. That’s why their called franking credits.

2020-06-10	21:58:23	"""Long term"" is a weird parameter. For example, a company like WPL is a business which has cyclical based earnings. If you compare the AT Chart of WPL and MQG, you'll get an entirely different result.

By Long term, do you mean set and forget for the next 10 years? If so, I think you'll want to be looking more at ALL, MQG, CKF, SYD etc. Business' which have a lot of *room* to grow, constantly growing revenue's, have the ability for M&A etc. 

CCP is a good one, although I'm yet to run the ruler over it, I'd be skeptical of bad debts/low rates in this post-pandemic environment. Baring that, I don't see why it wouldn't be a good long term hold. From what I hear, management are absolutely top shelf.

Selfwealth charges a flat $9.50 so technically you'd want your trade as big as possible to minimise your fees as a percentage of your trades.

I don't set stop losses or anything like that because my picks are generally not so volatile. In addition, even if I lose 30% of my bankroll I'm not going to lose sleep over it.

With any investment you make, if your expectation is to get around 7% a year return then you are going to do well.

If you invest to make 200% per year returns then you are going to be disappointed and poor at the end of it.

On the plus side, the 7% does add up over 5 years and it is essentially free money."	Wozar	0

I had a look at FLT and it isn't far off the same either.

I'm probably too new to understand this but it probably would appear that time is running out on these i.e. they are getting back to their old levels even if it isn't obvious? 

I bought $2k of WEB at $2.70 so sitting on 70% odd gain but I'm very conscious that it would have a ceiling much lower than its old $10 share price and have been trying to figure out what that would look like with all the additional shares on issue. 

Since they issued 150% additional capital my crude way of looking at it - which perhaps is the same as you are pointing out with market cap, which is easier to look at than mine:
The old $10 share price would be equal to:
$10 at 40% (representing the original shareholding), plus $1.70 at 60% (representing the new shares issued) = $5.02

Dunno if what I have done above is comparable though."	Shadowsfury	0

""The Xero Limited (ASX: XRO) share price has fallen almost 3% to $85.05.

Hear me out.

AGL is heavily reliant on coal but recognise their way forward with renewables.

The coal power plants are massive capital sinkholes and they’re going to dives them in time.

As a company with significant capital they can easily pivot to renewables.

Become a shareholder, vote in their meetings to push them on their way towards renewables.

Also, Infigen is cool as heck but don’t have significant capital to do super huge projects. They’ll more than likely get bought out by a big conglomerate."	HeckingLoveDogs	0

In the future you sell them, you have to pay the brokerage fee twice. If you purchase $1000 of shares and both brokerages cost a total of $40, then the shares would need to increase in value by 4% just for you to break even on the fees.

Larger buys reduce this ratio. I use SelfWealth, which gives a flat $9.50 brokerage fee, so for a $1000 purchase, the brokerage means the shares need to gain 1.9% of their value to break even."	Sagittar0n	0

2020-06-08	22:19:32	My thought exactly. I'm an ANZ customer so it just seems convenient. Also I noticed ANZ don't charge inactivity fees, while many other brokers will charge you. I guess if I go in with larger amounts (say $5-10k) then the difference between $10 or $20 brokerage fee is negligible.	youngbuckman	0
2020-06-08	22:24:54	Yeah brokerage kills you on $500 trades... if you factor in brokerage to buy and sell plus CGT. Let’s say your stock moves up 10% and you make $50. Well you have to take your $20 brokerage off. Then another $9 for CGT so 60%of your profit gets eaten up in fees! So your risking your whole $500 investment for a 4% gain if the stock moves 10%!. If you’re going $500 parcels you really need like 15-20% gains to make it worth while...and I mean if your consistently picking 15-20% winners in a normal market you should quit your job and open a hedge fund	Wetrapordie	0

2020-06-09	00:34:06	call me naive, but when you quote these percentages (15-20% gains), don't we need to apply some timeframe to give it context? E.g. if a stock you invest in today goes up 20% by 2021, then that's fantastic. If it goes up 20% by 2030, then you've made the equivalent of holding your money in a 2% interest bank account over 10 years.	youngbuckman	0

Australia should be 'free-moving' by the time it's summer - which in turn, means it's winter in Europe and KMD sales should see a marked increase.

Don't expect an overnight fortune - even if you buy now, it's something you should be holding, KMD does not look like it's in a bad market position at all, and should eventually reach $2 sooner rather than later.

2020-06-11	16:39:23	"This is a late reply but since noone else has covered it here, I'll explain why PE is irrelevant for TCL. They are triple stapled and one of those 'staples' has a unit trust structure that TCL uses to pay out the vast majority of their dividends as ""interest"" to the stapleholders (shareholders). That means that they don't pay dividends out of  'earnings' but before it. It's why most of the dividend is unfranked, and its designed this way to give Super investors a tax benefit. The E is therefore heavily underreported by traditional standards and FCF is the more relevant metric."	Loco4FourLoko	0

EV is high and has negative FCF for the past two years (total capex), I’m assuming you’re only using maintenance capex in your EV/FCF?

2020-06-09	07:49:27	"It's just rookie investors who have learnt a few buzz words and like to throw them out to sound smart. 

The sentiment of a stock determines which direction it goes. If people expect good results or a great report comes out, the stock price will increase, and that increase is ""priced in"" to reflect the optimism created by the new information. The positive reaction is multiplied as other investors notice the news and the price climb and they also jump on the bandwagon

COVID-19 hits, people panic and the media ruin sentiment, stock falls = ""priced in"". Right now, all the stimulus pumping and lockdown easing have caused prices to skyrocket. The positive expectations have to lead to the bulls running, thus the market has 'priced in' to reflect all the positivity. Then when sentiment changes due to some other event, the subsequent crash/fall will be 'priced in' to reflect the sentiment at that point in time.

2020-06-08	03:09:57	"Yeah well there's a reason they haven't made a profit yet. It's a high sales low margin operating model that is living off the hype of its potential. $4.8 Billion of transactions in 6 months for 180 Million of Afterpay revenue give it's a margin of 3.75% including late fees, this is nothing. 

I think it's totally reasonable that 3.75% of transactions could go deliquent seeing the target market. 

However, once APT has market control if they decide to raise fees by 1% Then there's a substantial income boost for the same risk of default. 

One thing that sticks out to me is in their cash flow statement, they are not net positive at all. Cash income from APT is less than cash paid to merchants and supplier. And this is not even taking into account financing and debt costs. 

It's a stock based off a pipe dream of being profitable in 5 years due to its market share and huge transaction volume. Similar to Uber or WeWork.

No one really cares about it though, as long as people are willing to pump equity to plug the losses I can't forsee the market changing their opinion on a stock that has seen a multi billion dollar valuation driven by increasing transaction volume over actual profits.

>For each order below $40, a maximum of one $10 late fee may be applied per order. For each order of $40 or above, the total of the late fees that may be applied are capped at 25% of the original order value or $68, whichever is less.

2020-06-08	20:45:31	That's the indicator to me that this type of business model is high risk. If it was worth it, any bank could offer a similar product, it's not a particularly unique idea or hard to set up.	slothonreddit	0
2020-06-08	23:42:35	That’s exactly what I thought. What’s there stopping a big 4 like Nab or CBA to invest a little bit and start their own BNPL system. They’d have the requirement credit checking based off of your account activity, etc. I think it would actually be a really good idea	power_prince	0
2020-06-08	15:19:52	" I saw the positve EBITDA figure for the Australian side, cashflow statements in my opinion show a different opinion. Cash receipts from merchants are $300 odd million less than actual cash revenue received from afterpay income. There is no breakdown on their cost of sales either, which makes it hard to justify. I'd argue that interest costs should be part of their business model and maybe are being   excluded from this. Not particularly transparent IMO. 

Acountant's can do amazing things! I think an example of this was Dick Smith's (not sure what the parent company was called) showed revenue growth and positive EBITDA but their CF statement showed the truth and hence they have collapsed."	Turbulent_Meerkat	0

Saying they're getting in on a transaction they wouldn't otherwise be involved in is like saying the fish and chip shop down the street is ""getting in on"" your parents using them rather than McDonald's.

And the company make less than $1M in revenue (According to simplywallstreet) and if that's true - and this mine actually gets nothing out of it, you're looking at LNG 2.0 (Pretty much money down the drain).

2020-06-08	20:35:34	"Personally I think it has potential, I have been watching for a while and bought when they released their latest report where they said they had permission to drill from land owners. 

What caught my eye is the previous owners went bust due to recovery issues in the plant, they employed a handful of contractors to come in and tell them how they could improve their recovery and from what I could make out of it is they ran out of time to implement these changes. 

So the amount of dirt for the plant wasn’t the issue and they have decided to go ahead with further exploration. So the major costs will be getting the plant back online (commissioning) and exploration. For the price I feel like it’s a decent punt. Couldn’t for the life of me find a company priced similar like it with a plant already built. A lot of Companies find great dirt and then go bust building a 100M+ plant..

I may do research into the contracts they hold and parties they are involved in. If their contracts are somewhat iron clad and span well into 2021, it might be worth riding the gains up until 2021 and take advantage of the growing EPS.

2020-06-07	20:10:37	"the 125% growth rate was derived from NPAT and P&L from Shaw and Partners. As production scales from 3.4Mt to 6Mt, revenue jumps from $218M to $313M and NPAT from $12M to $42M.

After production guidance is hit at 6Mt. Growth remains steady at 5% as economies of scale kick in, financing activities decrease and assumed demand keeps up. After 2021, NPAT after tax YoY is estimated at $42M, $45M, $47M, $49M. Which is growth of 7.1%, 4.4% and 4.2% which is averaged at 5.23%. Therefore i think a 5% growth rate is fair.

2020-06-07	22:53:31	"Congrats on your efforts so far those are some impressive gains! Please don't take any offence to the below, it is pretty much purely directed at my former self and is just my opinion.

I find it highly unlikely that someone who is new to investing can make a judgement call like 'Im not *as* confident in Zip as I am/was with Afterpay when I bought it.' Being able to have confidence and make trades in companies such as these with a high level of certainty regarding the outcome is some high level advanced shit and is extremely difficult for even experienced investors. Let's look on the flip side. So all other things being equal lets say you had the same 'confidence' in APT business model on Feb 19 2020 and you bought in then. I doubt you would have been as confident on month later when the price had fallen around 80%. So I think given hindsight there is a high level of bias that now confirms the previous feelings of confidence you had in APT and your own stock picking ability. Confirmation bias is a huge killer in investing so be aware of that. 

You say things like 'I've considered Z1P but I'm worried that there's too much hype surrounding it and the bubble will burst the second I jump in. The upside to them is they just made it to the U.S, which could be big.' To me your analysis such as this seems shallow and naive. These two sentences are packed with a lot of assumptions which you need to sort through through solid analysis and research. E.g. you say the upside is that they made it to the U.S... well... what about many of the other BNPL companies who have already or will soon make it to the US also. What happens when Shopify enters the BNPL market as planned later this year. How about if ZIPs expansion into US doesnt go as planned and growth is weaker than expected? I don't know the answers here and I don't think anyone does know how it will play out (not even the owners and hedge fund managers.) etc etc

So my advice would be to stop worrying about the missing out on the ZIP and SXL type companies etc and just go back to the very fundamentals. Learn slowly and steadily. Take your time. Learn about what might be the minimum amount you should invest in a single parcel of shares. Learn about different strategies and develop your own plan and goals. Look into different portfolio structures and allocations between ETFS and shares. Research biases in investing and what are some known truths... e.g. year on year well over 90% of traders cannot beat the market through individual stock picking. What should this mean to you? So you have beat the market this year by this strategy but how long will that last. Hopefully a while for your sake but by the time you retire what is almost certain is that you will not have beaten the market using your current approach which is far removed from sound investment strategy and in my opinion given you are new to investing is based on speculation at best."	taxidriver99	0

Yes you are wrong to assume that. It's possible but by no means is a reversion to the mean certainty. The company's operations have changed dramatically, they recently raised at a fraction of that price (surely if that was a certainty of going to 60-80c then everyone would jump at the obvious profit opportunity) 

That div yield is a trailing yield. I would be very surprised if they paid that yield given the state of their balance sheet."	akkatracker	0

For sure! You're helping me a tonne. 

>I find it highly unlikely that someone who is new to investing can make a judgement call like 'Im not as confident in Zip as I am/was with Afterpay when I bought it.'

Picking Afterpay over Zip, I asked myself ""Which company would I prefer to use myself?"" I liked Afterpay more because I liked that there were no monthly fees attached to purchases that would take longer than a month to pay off. At the time I bought it (and still), I see Afterpay being an option a *significant* amount more than any other option besides PayPal. That, to me, means the company is doing better than their competitors. That's where my confidence came from. Of course, I didn't see them coming close to $50 or anything, but I thought that maybe, with time, they'd reach $20 and I would be over the moon with that. 

>Confirmation bias is a huge killer in investing so be aware of that.

100%

>To me your analysis such as this seems shallow and naive. These two sentences are packed with a lot of assumptions which you need to sort through through solid analysis and research.

It is shallow and naive. I'm an honest-to-god noob with this stuff which is why I'm here.

>90% of traders cannot beat the market through individual stock picking. What should this mean to you?

Is the way to beat the market through investing in ETFs? ""Slower"" growth, but more consistent? Is that what this means? Could you expand on this a little more?

>By the time you retire what is almost certain is that you will not have beaten the market using your current approach which is far removed from sound investment strategy and in my opinion given you are new to investing is based on speculation at best.

What classifies as 'beating the market'? Is it a certain % of growth per year? Is it comparing your portfolio to the average ETF growth rate? 

I'm not necessarily looking to 'beat the market' per se. I just want to see some sort of growth, even if it isn't much. If I'm making more than I'm investing, I'll count that as a huge win. So far so good.

2020-06-08	19:20:10	"\- I see where your coming from. It’s really great to be invested in companies that you know and understand, this can often give you better insights into companies. However having confidence in companies you like and prefer to use can sometimes be meaningless in my opinion. You might like and prefer McDonalds but that doesn’t mean it’s going to crush KFC in the next decade. You might think Nike is the most superior brand and prefer to buy their clothes for various reasons but why should that give you more confidence in Nike than Adidas? Potentially your confidence could be misplaced and your assumptions that give you confidence could be wrong. I.e. it’s possible that you could see value in a company a get lots of use out of its products while the general population does not. 

\- As for stock picking and beating the market: [https://youtu.be/AecvTErBQY8](https://youtu.be/AecvTErBQY8)

\- You can consider the benchmark to beat as the S&P500 or the ASX200 

\- Youtube can help for starters. Lot's of channels. Reading different commentary sites, stock website and so on. Reading literature. Reading annual reports. Getting used to the language.

They're actually a fraction of earnings that the company wants to return to shareholders. Given growth plans may change and profits may change, the future dividend may change.

When we talk about yield, that's just dividend over the share price. Given we don't know the future dividend, the past is used - a good company will typically aim to increase or maintain their dividend. If you dug deeper of SXM - you'll see some earnings downgrades , making the yield hard to sustain."	akkatracker	0

Don't wrap yourself up too much in being concerned about splits between different ETFs and markets - there is no secret formula or best-practice so being too concerned about the intricacies just takes focus from the real goal.

When it comes to FAIR it is basically that we have a bit of a green/renewable tendency (inner-city avo-latte people). So, don't fully find higher MER and the sacrifice in some market diversification. Originally, had VESG, but I like having more control over my market allocations which trumped my morals. But possibly I will pursue this further in future with more ethical ETFs being created.

You are not going to see big changes in a short time unless there is unusual market movements (up and down), so have a long term plan and stick to it.  As your salary increases, you can invest more.

By your logic everything denominated in USD is hedging.

If your broker goes under, your CHESS shares are still yours.

To participate in a DRP you need to go through a different portal and when you buy shares you should receive a letter from that company detailing this, however it can be delayed or obtuse.

Most go through ComputerShare.com and once you use your Chess id (XIN/SRN) to make an account, you can then select what to do with the dividends (e.g. which bank account or participate in DRP/DSSP)."	Nirvana-L	0

Look at developing nations. Their stock markets go up all the time while tens of millions sit in squalor around the edges of a few shining city-beacons of business operations with near-western level prices. 

I've always thought that the OECD nations are moving toward the developing nations' model rather than visa versa. The sentiments of the owners of capital in the 2 zones are certainly the same. As unions and the advances they made in labour relations have been eroded (manifested by the rise of the ""gig economy"") there's nothing to stop the West becoming like Thailand.

So if 100,000 service industry workers no longer can pour coffee or serve meals, is that really going to dent sales of SUV's? It will, I think, but many are probably deluding themselves to justify buying stocks. This is probably a part of the answer."	hidflect1	0

2020-06-05	15:55:39	Does anyone use Opentrader - $5 a trade under $2500	Tmbabw	1
2020-06-05	16:29:29	If you’re only trading amounts under $2500 it’s cheaper. If you sell over it’s $15... so for example if you buy $2000 of shares and sell for $3000 you pay $20 where SW is $19... I personally like SW cause of their set fee that don’t scale.... that said if you don’t have a big budget and are planning on buying $500 parcels open trader is cheaper however you’re probably better off just parking your money in spaceship which is fee free and a good spread of businesses.

\- doesn't allow downloading of the terms and conditions on the first 'accept', can't copy/paste from the page to text. (easily defeated with tech, but still. annoying) (pdf's available later)  
\- call center doesn't sound like it is in Australia (long delay). Customer rep I spoke with seemed less fluent in English than I was expecting. (no accent, but exchange was very yes/no rather than sentences). I was just calling to see who answered the phone.  


\- 48 hrs to approve new account.  
\- cash balance required before placing orders. usual 2 day settlement.

2020-06-05	23:40:23	Watched a presentation from ex-Selfwealth CEO in 2019 where he mentioned at $9.50/trade they still had up to 50% margin.  Surely then there's opportunity for competition to squeeze this price down.  Sorry I know this is OT	Toesies_tim	0
2020-06-07	12:19:47	"I use them I switched over from openmarket equix for the cheaper trades on the low end, I've had no problems with them and it's liked with my Macquarie cash account so I'm quite happy with that, trades are fast, they are CHESS sponsored, no complaints could move to SW but really couldn't be bothered with the hassle tbh.

Your right about mobile though it's terrible but I tend to only do trades on my desktop anyway."	MachinaDoctrina	0
2020-06-17	21:15:38	"Ok so just as an FYI if you are a rookie like me and use these guys you need to know that unlike Selfwealth, who only shows money available to withdraw after the 2t days your CMT through open trader is like with more traditional traders where funds are not actually withdrawn yet so it's possible to withdraw money which hasn't actually cleared as in trade may not have even been withdrawn yet (I'm assuming this happens behind the scenes on SW but you just only see a withdrawal balance once it's T+2). So I got burned for massive fee of  $110 (which is a lot when you only have a small balance). 


So cheap trades for people who know what there doing and are trading less than 2500 but if you can't be bothered keeping track of what still hasn't come out before you withdraw money (because you have to login through your CMT account I couldn't withdraw directly through the platform like sw) then don't do it. I assume this is no different to trading with CommSec and other platforms but because I had only been with SW I stupidly didn't know this. Just as an FYI for other beginners. Sucks because there customer service was awesome but given the dodgy mobile experience and now the massive fee I'm done.

edit: ok so turns out CMC, Selfwealth and possibly others also don't allow the withdrawal of uncleared buy trades so if your like me and don't want to mix up what trades have cleared yet definitely look for an option that doesn't let you withdraw unsettled buys. I'm sure for others the trading on uncharged balances is great but not for someone like me. Good to know."	Tmbabw	0

2020-06-13	18:28:33	"Hey, please let us know if you have any feedback with your experience, we are working very hard to be the best!! We spun out of OpenMarkets, which is the largest independent retail stockbroker (ASX participant), currently a little behind CMC (ANZ/Suncorp) and NAB by turnover. 

All of our staff is onshore, our tech team is in Brisbane and customer service in Melbourne. The guys have been under the pump last few months, so apologies about that - heaps of volume coming through and we're hiring like crazy. All the delays are currently due to macquarie approving the banking. 

we're about to do work on the mobile side atm. we agree - it's terrible. We're working on adding advanced conditional orders atm (if done OCOs, etc) in a super user-friendly pad and we'll get to tweaking the mobile after that. Hopefully, by mid-late July we address the issues and have it in the app store.

2020-06-05	16:49:00	Yer it's mobile website only from what I can see and it's not good at optimising for mobile. However for me at the moment the trade price is appealing to me with the position size of my trades and the desktop option seems pretty customisable.	Tmbabw	0
2020-06-05	16:39:35	It’s like that’s with ComSec you can do the $10 trade under $1000 then goes to $19.95... so if you brought a $500 parcel and it doubles to $1000 you pay $29.95 brokerage.... that’s why I moved to SW it’s the lowest fee and no surprises come sale time	Wetrapordie	0

Remember that you are looking to invest regularly and over the next 10, 20, 30+ years.  That is why exchange rate and any other excuse that you want to use is not material.  Earn as much as you can, save as much as you can and invest as much as you can.  Good luck."	3rd_in_line	0

They've just signed a huge international deal, effectively same product as Afterpay, a lot of people consider it a more user friendly version of Afterpay. Once figures start coming out with the additional north american market earnings, another rise seems imminent. Also once recession sentiment calms down, surely people will begin to notice that there is no reason for this Afterpay competitor to be a fifth of the price!!

Z1P is a decent company and it’s only just moving into the American market with its acquisition of QuadPay which is a massive player in the BNPL sector in America. The high and now low is from people pumping and dumping as well as new investors being spooked out of the market due to the price lowering. If you hold, it will likely go up in the months to come as Z1P seems like a solid company and many seem to prefer Z1P over APT based on user interface. 

That said, I have shares invested however have done my research and am confident in holding. You probably shouldn’t be trading if you’re not confident in the companies you’re investing in and willing to hold during the lows. DYOR and GLTAH"	Secr3tS0da	0

Zip, yes it did buy QuadPay this week which caused a peak in its price but that was just for those 2 days. I don’t think it’s price will go higher until people see any results. US is in shit right now with all riots and stuff midst of Corona. I don’t see anything happening because they just bought QuadPay. Also FYI, QuadPay has 0.09% market share in USA, Afterpay is about 2%. Also another thing worth mentioning, there’s myriad of other buy now pay later services in USA unlike Australia.

I've also been doing some work with SelfWealth on their data feed into the Class SMSF and portfolio reporting software, which will significantly improve efficiency and make the admin easier (and dare I say it lower cost) for SelfWealth users with an SMSF.

I suppose it works for them because if you succumb to that pressure it encourages you to trade more.  But it encourages a short term mindset I think and if you’re a buy and hold long term investor you just need to ignore all that noise and just be happy with you’re flat rate brokerage."	simonboundy	0

I had heard of IG Markets but mostly from crypto and forex people which I am not.  I hadn't even realised they did shares as well.

Discounting the fixed price options which only apply if you are trading with lunch money, the prices on the IG Site say .1% or .05% of the value of the trade which, whilst admittedly cheaper than Commsec, would still leave you paying hundreds of dollars per trade!

This is why I am so amazed.  I put through a trade on selfwealth that would have cost $750 on IG and it still only cost me $10!

I don't want to discourage anyone with low amount trades from chasing the cheapest rates but even the people trading with low amounts hope to one day trade with large amounts and SW seems to be better for that.

SWF should save you a good deal when doing big transactions like that. You'd be one of the customers they lose money on (or indirectly, with OM losing on that transaction), except if they make it back on interest or possibly FOREX exchange if you use their international trading once released.

It's in progress.  Only 50/1400 companies added so far, and still having more features to add (a lot of links might still be dead or buggy at the moment).  I hope to have it ready for release in basic form in ~10 days.

I've made a great profit from SWF and am wanting to replicate that.  I'm hoping the new website will give me some interesting insights to be able to find other good opportunities.  In particular, small cap tech companies, but maybe others too.

Once the website is done, there will be free data (probably 3 months for every company) and premium plans too.

That being said, I've had my stock account set up ages ago and have just been putting certain companies of interest on my watchlist and just observed them on a day to day basis. 

I use ANZ trading, yes I know the broker fees are horseshit, it was just easy for me because I'm with ANZ banking, but they also provide a news headlines feature for Australian companies.

In terms of research I use those news headlines on the ANZ investing page and then further delve into the rabbit hole to understand everything going on with it, I then make my own prediction on how it'll play out (E.g. Z1P sealing the deal with QuadPay/implications of going into US market/how that played out with Afterpay/How acquisition and capital raise events typically influence stock price/ etc.). 

Observing those outcomes, whether I'm right or wrong I would then use that as a case study and just google why the market behaved in that certain way. There's almost always some kind of stock market answer to whatever case study you propose. So I delve into the rabbit hole of that case scenario. This helps me eliminate the vastness of different stock trading possibilities and just allows me to focus on the scenario of my certain trade interests. It's helped me so far now that I've pulled the trigger on some stocks. Also just worth understanding the wider picture. Looking into 1yr to 5yr history of certain companies are good especially if you want to capitalize on the COVID bounce back. Good to see what price point they normally sit at prior to the economy collapse, and research the certainty of their financial recovery.

I'm new to stocks as well, I'm no financial guru but if I'm ever unsure about something, I just trawl the internet as much as possible."	fergie_d	0

Watch this go for a while to get acquainted with Finance. Maybe start following a couple companies in VAS/VAT that you buy and like and next time you have money you can start thinking about stock. As a bonus, you will a fair amount of dividend (roughly 5% a year) that you use to fund individual future stock purchases as you get more confident.

2020-06-05	02:27:46	"Short answer? It depends.

From Commsec's website the brokerage fees are as follows if you ""Trade online and settle your trade to a CDIA or CommSec Margin Loan"":



$10.00 (Up to and including $1,000)

$19.95 (Over $1,000 up to $10,000 (inclusive))

$29.95 (Over $10,000 up to $25,000 (inclusive))

0.12% (Over $25,000)

This means: 

$10 = a minimum of 1% (at 1k, more if the trade size is less)

$19.95 = 0.1995% (for 10k) - 1.99% (for $1001)

$29.95 = 0.1198% (for 25k) - 0.299% (for $10001)

So assuming you want to stay with Commsec for whatever reason (convenience, linked to your existing savings account, T+2 settlement, etc etc), it's clear ideally you'd want your trades to be 25k each or more to minimize fees. Or at the very least, making your trades over 2k (and as much over 2k as possible).

You can do the same calculations with other online brokers such as nabtrade, ig, cmc, selfwealth to see if there are cheaper options (hint: there are)."	jagershock	0

I've just seen that if you use Commsec's app (Pocket) it's $2 up to $1000, and 0.2% on anything above $1000. So it's the cheapest brokerage they have for any trade up to $15,000.

Haven't used it myself though so I don't know how easy or good it is."	oslosyndrome	0

2020-06-05	03:03:02	I think those lower fees are only if you are using their CDIA account, otherwise it's always $29.95. It's just like a standard bank account with them that is tied to your commsec account. Would recommend signing up for one if you are using commsec.	Zotus	0
2020-06-05	04:01:42	"1. While 0.2% isn't terrible, in all honestly it's not fantastic either. Unless you only have <5k, selfwealth is still cheaper.

2020-06-04	21:47:33	"Did a DCF on these guys last night and got a more undervalued figure than that, prompting me to look into their financial statement this morning.

They have huge debt with massive retail uncertainty and centres just reopening now. In Europe, their share price has steadily declined from €250 in 2015 down to around €66 now. I'm not sure if they were still charging rent to their customers but since re-opening stores things are looking more positive. 

I'm very tentative on them right now, they have rose about 20% this week but the falls are just super worrying. Also their plan for debt repayment means they are selling more centres (sold off 5 last year already) to focus on their higher yielding centres. Not a bad idea. But they're also using derivatives to try stave off the debt. Some bad purchases due to corona could see that debt multiply with earnings potentially in the shitter due to lockdowns.

They were also very vague in their attempts to rationalise lower retail spending and how to combat that. Super interested to hear the opinion of people who have looked into them for longer than the 12 hours that I have!

Edit: typo"	San_Marzano	0
2020-06-05	02:14:56	"URW has shopping centres in Europe and the US - Scentre has shopping centres here in AUS. 

Have a look at Scentre's financial statement from last year (you can do the same with URW of course) 

https://www.scentregroup.com/getmedia/29525333-6682-45a2-b145-951e3082b63c/FY19-Appendix-4E-and-Annual-Fin-Report_18Feb20.pdf  

Last year they had just shy of $2b revenue, with the main cost being interest on loans (approx. $500mil), and with other costs deducted, had about $1b profit... this has been relatively stable over the last few years, with the share price hovering around $4 (i.e. a nice stable dividend stock)... They also have substantial access to liquidity ($1.8billion+), and a relatively long time until debt maturity, so I think it's unlikely that there would be an issue for them to cover it.  

My reasoning for purchasing was along the lines of: Things will trend to go 'back to normal'... let's pessimistically say in 2 years. Which means (all else being equal) the stock should trend upwards back to $4 over this time... the share is approximately $2.50, which means that it should have solid growth until then.  Now I think that things will recover MUCH more quickly than that.

A similar logic applied to URW (although made more complex by the international nature of the company)."	jamesmnz	0

2020-06-04	14:20:26	One thing to consider is often that their share price is so low (e.g. .002 dollars) that any movement, with the next possible value being .003 dollars, results in massive on paper increases to the share value.	JustKaiOK	0
2020-06-04	15:03:17	"Yes, but the problem is that there is so much less volume and price movement in small caps that it is hard to sell at the increased price.

If you buy a stock at 2c and it goes up to 3c that is only a paper increase of 50%. If you tried to sell at 3c you'd likely find that there are no takers (after all it's the same logic as buying APT at $50 and trying to sell at $75 in the current environment), after listing at 3c and having no buyers for a while you'll likely find that you need to drop the price back to 2c to find a buyer (0% gain and you've paid brokerage twice).

There's not much flexibility to move at prices between 2c and 3c (although some stocks will allow 0.005 movements) so you can't lock in smaller increases the same as you could if you bought APT for $50 and sold for $50.05, $50.50, $51.05 etc."	Mifftup	0

2020-06-04	21:24:45	"So a complete transaction of $1000 will cost you 3% of your profits. Or assuming you get the average return on the asx of 8.8% that's roughly 4 months before you breakeven. I usually try to keep it at least under 1%.

If you are unaware you can use the selfwealth app which is $9.5 flat fee on all transactions to reduce your costs or just buy a larger volume of shares at once so I'd buy one or two of those stocks. If you want diversity I'd put all your money into an etf.  


As for zip there are two factors firstly I feel that the buy now pay later market is overvalued as seen by the massive dip they took during the last sell off. Secondly zip has suddenly seen a massive rise in value in a short time frame and I usually avoid buying when that happens. That being said people have been saying afterpay is massively overvalued since the start and it has only been only going up."	DeathorGlory9	0
2020-06-05	01:39:19	"OP listen to this post. Brokerage fees are a killer. Take your syd trade for example. 90*5.7 = $513, and you mentioned you use commsec who charges $10 for every trade under $1000. $10 brokerage on a $513 trade is 1.95% in brokerage.

Just as a comparison there are full service brokers in Macquarie Bank who charges 1% (although they do have a higher minimum).

Also consider if you sell Syd today @ 6.1. 7% profit sounds pretty good until you realise that's only $36 (90 shares * 6.1 - 90 shares * 5.7) before brokerage. At $10 per trade you're giving up more than 50% of your profits (since there's brokerage when you buy and when you sell).

But it seems like you want to be an active trader, and there's nothing wrong with that. Nevertheless I suggest you keep an eye on your brokerage fee percentages.

Memes aside I'm also incredibly cautious on BNPL stocks such as APT/Z1P/OPY/etc. There's absolutely a chance they'll be the next Visa/Mastercard, but with so much speculation money going into these stocks it's basically like gambling right now.

Personally I wouldn't put a single cent into these shares if I couldn't afford to lose a significant chunk or even all of it.

All that negativity aside, like what some other people have said, it's impressive you're investing at such a young age. Just be careful you're actually ""investing"" and not ""gambling""."	jagershock	0

Perhaps it is a little high, but the peace of mind and ease of use of the platform keeps me there over something like selfwealth.

I use CommSec for those offerings and SelfWealth when I need to make trades.

Their fees are not fine, they will add up over time ($20 to buy and $20 to sell each time), particularly with large size trades where past a certain trade size, the brokerage fee will be a % of the trade which could cost hundreds where SelfWealth would be a flat $9.50.

In terms of wanting to buy without cash, If you are desperate to make a trade immediately and have no money in the brokerage account then sure use CommSec for those situations if it justifies the higher brokerage, otherwise i would just transfer some money into the SelfWealth account and leave it there if I know I’ll be buying stocks over the short to mid term.

2020-06-04	14:33:28	yes if you want to be more weighted in CBA it makes sense. VAS is just a lazy way of replicating a Portfolio of securities. For example Lets say CBA accounts for 10% of the VAS weight. If you believe its not enough you could buy X amount of CBA to bring you up to say 20% weight where your portfolio is now VAS + CBA	FlimsyDrawing9	0

2020-06-04	04:51:50	Yeah, it will be a long-term thing. Buy Now Pay Later companies are becoming the new norm and Zip is in a great position to evolve into an international market leader. The fact that ASXBets spastics compare it to APT after its recent surge is only a good thing for its price, however, if you look deep at this company you can see that it's built on really solid foundations. They're genuinely a great company that's ready to expand, and they've been growing immensely year by year - even if their stock market price in recent years doesn't reflect it.	roytaz	0
2020-06-04	15:02:12	For someone that’s used afterpay and zip pay countless times, I honestly thing Z1P will overtake afterpay at some point because of the flexibility. I way prefer zip because you can chose when to pay and how much you wanna pay, whereas afterpay is a fixed 4 term payment. Zips flexibility has the potential to overtake afterpay. Although in saying this, afterpay could easily incorporate a flexible payment term to their program, which would most likely fuck over zip.	CoreyHartland	0

2020-06-04	17:10:50	Yeah that’s what worries me. I’ve been in stores where they have preferred afterpay over Zip. I’m worried everyone is on a big hype train. Even in Australia, I know literally no one who uses Zip or has really heard of it? In saying that, that’s a small sample size but I believe if Afterpay or any form of card introduces a similar program to Zip they will take over.	bazXO	0

2020-06-04	12:46:45	"Great question. 

I don’t know the answer fully but my understanding is they do in the form of credit cards but in recent years credit cards have a bad wrap (for good reason) and BNPL companies are the new credit cards for people who have been warned about the dangers of credit cards. So 10 years ago some 21 year old who wanted some makeup or a new video game might pull out the cradle card the bank automatically issued them when they turned 18. But nowadays people are more aware how dangerous that is. Instead they see the little Zip or Afterpay logo and think, hmm 200 now or 4 payments of 55 on payday. That seems better. It takes the guesswork and stuff out of it I assume. Mind you I have never used either service so I can’t say for sure, just going off what I have heard and seen with friends 

Again I am not an expert this is just my understanding"	redditrabbit999	0

2020-06-03	18:22:06	My understanding is that anyone can apply for zippay and get approved, whereas credit card applications have certain criteria that need to be met by the lender. Zippay is also a lot more appealing to the younger generation rather than getting a credit card.	jimmsee	0
2020-06-03	22:56:55	"I used ZIP when I had a massive dental bill I couldn't pay upfront. They offered me >12 months interest free, with a $6 per month maintenance fee. If I'd put that on my credit card instead, I would have been paying a lot more per month in interest ($6 is like 7% annual interest for $1,000, even less for larger sums).

Additionally, I imagine if you juggle one or more of these accounts (Afterpay, Zip, Latitude) you can then extend the interest free periods of an existing credit card. Of course this is only useful if you can't clear your credit card debt each month."	HotLaksa	0

2020-06-04	21:48:12	"I have used both and love them. It allows me to spend in little chunks instead of upfront. Credit cards come with interest. This does not. I have a job, I know when I'll be paid, I know I can pay it off. But I also do not buy anything I can't already pay for entirely upfront.

For example, I had two dentist appointments a while ago. Now I could afford to pay for them at the time but I opted to Afterpay it instead. This means every payday I get dealt a little jab instead of the entire blow in one go. This is convenient as it allows me flexibility with the rest of my funds.

But let's say I Afterpay'd those dentist appointments and was fired from my job immediately after. What then? I still have payments to make. Well, as I said before, I can still afford to pay for the entire thing.

The enticing part about Afterpay and Zip isn't that I can buy immediately for a low price and not worry about what happens after, it's that it allows me freedom and flexibility with how I move my money and time around. 

Of course, there will be financially irresponsible people who try to use this as some kind of loophole without the foresight that the rest needs to be paid off, or even have the means to do so. But as far as I'm aware, those people are locked from using Afterpay as soon as possible.

How much I spend hasn't changed. Only how and when my money money moves around. I would never ever use a credit card."	Dark_Jester	0

2020-06-04	04:52:34	Price isn't a good way to compare stock values, you want to look at market capitalisation instead. Market cap is calculated by number of shares * share price. So Z1P has 390.39 million shares at a price of $6.35 for a market cap of $2.48bn. APT has 267.37 million shares at a price of $52.25 for a market cap of $13.97bn.	eightslipsandagully	0

2020-06-03	23:46:59	I currently hold 25,000 SCG shares, probably one of the best value stocks remaining on the ASX imo, they're not going under anytime soon, shopping malls in Aus/NZ aren't dying out anytime soon. Currently sitting at 23% profit.	agency-man	0
2020-06-03	22:51:38	"Which Westfield?

Scentre Group, which owns Westfield-branded shopping centres in Australia and New Zealand?

Or Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which owns many shopping centres including all Westfield-branded shopping centres outside Australia and New Zealand. 

Both are listed on the ASX. 

The worst is probably over for both with big gains in share price today. In the medium term I feel Scentre Group might do better than UMG."	Kitty015	0
2020-06-04	02:24:27	I agree. People are always quick to jump out of good companies during a crisis like this and over exaggerate the negative effects. Solid balance sheet and profitability which i expect won't take much of a hit. Plus it sounds like there were only a few instances where rent was re-negotiated/reduced on a store by store basis with the majority of shops continuing to pay rent over this time. Solid company.	pretaypretypretygood	0

2020-06-03	18:11:39	Yep, you can get up to $25k in credit effectively that needs to either be settled with a payment within 2 business days, or if you were to sell the position you either get the profit or loss of the trade. Obviously risky if you start playing with money you don’t have, but I suppose it’s good so you don’t miss out on having to wait for funds to transfer.	butyouhaveheardofme	0

2020-06-03	17:28:15	"Profits are considered regular taxable income and are taxed as such. There is a rule with CGT however that if you hold a stock for more than 12 months, then any profits are halved for tax purposes. For example, if you make $1000 profit on a stock, but you bought the stock 2 months ago, then you pay tax on the full $1000. However, if you hold the stock for 12 months before selling then sell it for $1000 gain, you will only have to pay tax on $500. I recommend checking out the actual ATO rulings regarding CGT before getting too involved with buying and selling.

QAN - no airline in the world makes good money over the long term and shareholders are always the ones to lose.  VAS is weighted heavily to banks and miners and they are not really growth stocks in the future, with the banks glory days well and truly behind them.  

I would buy more VAS and NDQ (or another ETF such as VHDG) until you have about $50,000 in them.  Then, by that time, you will have an idea of other companies you want to invest in.  Remember you are in these for another 20-30 years, at least.  Best advice I can give is keep on buying and don't sell anything.  Invest a couple of thousand as often as you can.  

> Hoping to deposit a few thousand and just delete the commsec app for a  few years. I also have all my dividends reinvested directly back into  the company to save on brokerage fees. 

Don't expect to just buy $15k worth of shares and come back in 20 years time expecting big things.  At 7% compound interest, your money will roughly double every 10 years and you will have $60k in 20 years. But if you can invest $1k a month for the next 20 years, you will have close to $600k in 20 years.  Earn as much as you can, save as much as you can and invest as much as you can. Good luck."	3rd_in_line	0

2020-06-03	15:21:21	It’s normal, I had the same thing happen when I received WEB shares through an entitlement offer. The shares are applied to your account without any change to your current average purchase price which obviously won’t be correct, but you can manually change your average purchase price for any of the shares in your portfolio through the web interface (not the mobile app unfortunately). Just click on the price when viewing your holdings and you can edit, but you’ll have to calculate the new average price yourself.	spagenfreude	0
2020-06-03	16:06:29	The reason I'm commenting is due the the amount of shares I received in the SPP.

My thinking is that I should of landed somewhere between 300-400 shares. Can someone explain why I only received the minimum amount of shares? Thanks!	TheDeatox	0

2020-06-02	20:33:06	"If you buy the right individual shares, they will definitely be better than an ETF. But being able to buy the right shares, diversify enough and be knowledgeable enough to be able to do this is definitely not for everyone. ""Friends"" can be the absolute worse source for advice at times.

I would recommend for anyone who is starting out to start with a couple of ETFs to get some diversity and to put your toe into the investing water.  Then maybe add a few individual companies and see how you go.  Some people find that individual companies can be too volatile for their own risk, so ETFs make things a bit easier.  Putting half of your money into ""1 or 2 companies"" is high risk, regardless of what companies you are talking about.

- Diversification and rebalancing that is managed for you, rather than you having to do it yourself.
- Savings on brokerage by buying into an ETF that aligns with your investment strategy, rather than buying individual shares and paying brokerage on each one.
- Exposure to investment options that are under-represented in the Australian market (NDQ being a prime example) or not available at all as a direct option on the ASX (international companies, etc.)
- Leveraged and/or hedged investment vehicles like GEAR and BBOZ.

2020-06-02	22:01:17	Yes, if you buy and sell shares on the same day for a profit you will be credited the difference, minus brokerage, in two business days.	PeacePlsDawg	0
2020-06-02	20:14:15	By this logic you could buy shares, then sell them at a profit, with nothing being debited from your account, receiving the profit 2 days later? Am I missing something here? The only risk is your shares not selling or selling at a loss, at which point youre liable for the difference?	looeymooey	0
2020-06-02	23:25:44	What happens if you buy stocks on day one and then sell stocks you already had on day 2. Would you still have to move money into the commsec account or would it take money from the stocks you sold	matesrates8	0

2020-06-02	17:18:55	To buy a share you'll need a seller. I'm assuming your order was not filled because there were no sellers at the price you've specified.	burnttoast1944	0
2020-06-02	17:23:08	I see. When I place the order should I select one of the sellers to the left of the order menu? Would that be more likely to go through. I apologise if these seem to be silly questions, it is my first order ever and I can't find any help anywhere else.	jenellesinjail	0
2020-06-02	17:34:18	While market depth shows you where buyers and sellers are, the current market price of the asset is the best gauge of where you will be able to find sellers as that is where transactions are taking place.	burnttoast1944	0
2020-06-02	17:49:30	okay i see. can you advise how long it will usually take for an order to be accepted? and is $1k too low? should i invest more?	jenellesinjail	0
2020-06-02	17:56:31	"Depends on what you are buying. Small quantities are almost always filled, the smaller the investment, the easier it is to be filled. You shouldn't run into liquidity problems at 1k! This is because the market turns over millions of dollars every day! Because so many people are buying and selling at the same time, you don't need to find a single person who wants to sell you $1k worth of shares. You'll likely find hundreds selling a lot more than that and your buy order will be swept up by them. 

If you place a buy order at market value it should be almost instant (unless it is a weird penny stock or something)."	burnttoast1944	0

2020-06-03	15:41:29	"ANZ's in my long-term portfolio, bought it at $27 months ago, and recently went baller in, twice the size, at 16$, recently.

So I have a family car in the latter trade and that's a bit of change to me and would say it'll likely have to reinstate its dividend over time and that the US KBW Bank Index, which topped out in early 2018, seems to be recovering from a far lower base than the S&P 500s swings. Also US NASDAQ is near record highs, the oil price is recovering, the rapist in the White House will probably be gone in a year, and China relations, improve, so which Australian bank has some Asia business going on? All of them, but ANZ has some of that 'story' if you will. Also, great management, CEO is smart and caring. See: empathy in leadership

\#edit: I also bought Westpac at the highs before the AUSTRAC sucker punch and general selloff, but didn't double down in that, despite the fact I thought 'such was a sucker punch', that polleaxed WBC down 'unduly'.. in that.. it shouldn't have been cut in half.. 60%.. wherever its lows were, relative. You know, they weren't consciously there trying to approve the laundered money knowing what some of it was. With evil intent.

2020-06-01	23:40:47	"> I'd honestly would expect majority of the guys who went down the local TAB for a punt to just do it online after this shit

You have to go with what you believe. If you think online will totally dominate and no one will go back to their old ways, then possibly invest in those stocks.  Longer-term I believe online gambling will take a greater share, but the older established businesses such as TAH will still have a chance to recover think.

2020-05-30	15:31:26	Practical Questions About Investing	skankwilliams1	1
2020-05-30	16:31:23	"I Have only been investing for a year now, but this is what I do:

1. Research: I use financials from the company's website, googlefinance, yahoofinance and there is another nice place called simplywallst.
For discussion on asx stocks, hotchopper is informative.

2. News and updates: You can use Googlenews for specific companies, yahoofinance has some good articles, hotchopper keeps you in the loop, sydney market herald is a very good one which provides daily updates on the markets. Your broker will probs also have morning briefs you can look at. Investing.com also helps.

3. I don't necessarily think there is much of a strategy for buying shares. Just look whether it is undervalued compared to the norm, whether the company has good strong growth potential. I recommend putting a buy order in at a price you are happy to buy at, if you buy at market, it's a little more risky as during the day it can have high volatility, and prices can change almost instantly, which changes what price you entered at. I normally buy low (compared to average price over a year or so), get some dividends then sell at a couple of dollars over.

4. As long as the company is in a good upwards trend over it's maximum graph timeframe, the company should keep heading up. There shouldn't be any impulsive selling unless the stock is highly volatile or has been showing decreased profitability over time, or stuff like pandemics happen. Stocks are usually uses for long term investments, so if you want you can always put in a sell order at a good price you are happy with, and if by chance the stock does fall drastically, then it just means you haven't done enough research on it.

5. I don't generally structure my watchlists. I mainly keep the ones I am mostly likely to buy at the top and less relevant ones at the bottom.

2020-05-30	22:13:26	"> Research: How do you go about this. I understand the fundamentals in terms of markets, balance sheet, P/E ratios etc. I'm more referring to what is the best place to find these financials in a semi readable format? It always feels like everyone is signed up to some news letter that shows every companies financials.

Firstly, if the company is great, management will bend over backwards to tell you how great it is. Likewise, if the company is shit, management will bend over backwards to tell you how great it is. The trick is, you have to learn to read annual reports and to read between the lines. That's what Buffet is a master at. This is a real skill that comes from experience only, sadly.

> When buying shares, what is the best strategy to get the lowest cost, or should I just buy at market to avoid potentially missing out before a price rise.

A couple of options: if you want to buy it, buy it. (ie, at market). If you think it's a good price at eg $12.00 but not at $12.01, then you should buy it at limit (I think this shows why limit orders are a bit dumb). On the other hand, if you want it in the range of $12.00 but you're at work and can't watch the markets, then sure, put in a limit order and it'll be hit or it won't be. Another option is to ladder - split your buy into chunks and place limit orders at $12.00, $11.50, $11.00 and so on. How big each chunk is and how far apart they are depends on how many you have and how far you're willing to go to be fully committed. Think it's a fair price at $12.00? And that at $10.00 you think it's really cheap and want more? And at $8.00 you're willing to bet everything you own on it? That tells you the range of your ladder.

> Once you own shares, are there any general measures you use to avoid losses? If so does this change depending on the type of stock? I was thinking when it comes to stronger companies to not have this to avoid crystallising losses. But when it comes to riskier stock, to have a rule to sell when a share drops by a certain % and sell some if it rises by a certain % to take profits.

Exactly the same as for buying. Like, *exactly* the same. Keep emotion out of it. If you're happy to sell, sell. Put ladder sells in. Put a stop-loss sell on too if you're really worried.

> How do you structure your watch-lists? By industry, by type of stock (fast grower, long term hold, riskier short term)?

Doing detailed analysis of a company takes 10-100 hours *per company*, and 90% of the time you'll it's fairly priced anyway. If you don't have time to do that, then don't kid yourself - you're relying at least a little on luck. If you realistically don't have that time (which most people don't), check out some good ETF's instead.

Personally, I like BetaShares ETF's over Vanguard. Mostly because I like the company more though."	algernop3	0

2. Generally I use the ASX app to keep up with announcements for the companies I follow, other than that generally reading on Reddit, Twitter and a few news websites will be informative. Unless you’re trading the week to week news isn’t that important.

2020-05-30	16:44:25	Quickfs.net for a solid summary of ratios and financial statements. If you’re taking a deep dive I’d recommend going through the annual report and going over it all yourself but as a fast and easy summary it’s fantastic to easily filter through stocks. I’d avoid using your brokers info unless you know how they calculate certain ratios. They have a conflict of interest with you, they’ll sugar coat things to encourage buying. Lots of companies will use different ways to calculate P/E, P/B, ROIC etc. so going over it yourself is always a must.	vBocaj	0

2020-05-30	19:50:12	"If you are new to investing and living in Australia, VAS (in my humble opinion) is the best way to get started: 

1) Vanguard is a reputable company

2) Management fees are pretty low (may not be the lowest but to start with the impact to your portfolio will immaterial)

3) Good exposure to the overall AUD Stock Market at low entry cost

4) Decent diversification to start investing (various companies are held in the ASX 200 like banks, various metals and energy stocks, grocery companies, real estate and some AUD techno companies)

5) Allows you to regularly invest small amounts (i.e. dollar cost averaging)

Start with investing as much as you can by buying VAS and start reading/following some of the stocks held within the VAS ETF based on companies/products/services that you are interested in. Let's say for roughly a year.

Once you feel a bit more comfortable you can start buying something like VAT next for another year to get exposure to oversees (i.e. US). Same principle, start following companies/product/services held within VAT that interest you. Let's say for another you.

After a couple of years of doing this, doing lots of reading, you will have a better feel for what investing really is (i.e. NOT trading) and how even a couple of years of time horizon may not be enough to see interesting returns. 

Then you can decide if you want to invest in other things:

1) more specialized ETFs

2) individual stocks

3) more diversified ETFs (e.g. Vanguard all world ex-US) 

Or you might prefer staying the course. The key is to remind yourself that 90% of really smart and informed investors do not beat the market OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. That being said, investing can nonetheless be super interesting.

One last thought: if you feel like you might need some of the money at some stage (e.g. buying a house, doing a post-graduate) maybe don't put all you have in stock. Put some in a cash savings account and/or some kind of bond ETFs like VAF or VACF (let's say anywhere from 20% to 40% of your portfolio depending on your tolerance to risk). 

Don't take my word for it though, all there is to know is in this book:

2020-05-29	19:27:56	"NDQ isn't necessarily a hugely long-term hold. Nearly 17.5% gain in the last 6 months alone, and almost 20% p.a. on average since inception, those are dynamite figures. Past performance yada yada future blah blah, but it's hard to deny that NDQ has done exceptionally well for itself.

If you're hellbent on single stocks, NEA would be my bet as it's still somewhat undervalued. Standard disclaimers apply though."	ingenieurmt	0

2020-05-30	00:22:30	Diversifying for the sake of diversification is a pointless task. Owing 20 stocks of average companies because you're too lazy to look into the balance sheet won't be a very long-term hedge against risk when compared to analysing a handful of companies and picking a few that have solid balance sheets, business models and future outlooks.

Which is reflected in the difference in the multiples represented by their share prices. 

I don't own that particular ETF or any of those stocks myself apart from ALU and for the most part prefer to look overseas for tech stocks, but the top holdings in that ETF aren't just selected by throwing darts and I wouldn't call them ""average companies""."	spaniel_rage	0

2020-05-29	19:36:09	"My thoughts are that the businesses and industries that you would THINK are undervalued due to how much they've been affected in the last few months are actually the ones that are the most inflated because a  bunch of people thought exactly the same as you did and have now pumped up the price. Almost every business across all industries is in 'undervalued' territory, and funnily enough most of those that have recently hit 'fairly valued' are the exact businesses that have taken the hardest hits, because every man and his dog who just got into trading made the exact same assumptions you're making.

It's better to go with some reputable stocks in businesses not affected - firstly because people didn't flock to them and bump the actual value of the share up on the assumption it was a good time to buy them and secondly because these businesses that are in less affected industries will recover much faster.

I mean once flying stopped everyone flocked to Air NZ and Quantas stocks and now they are valued higher than they have been at times when the planes were *actually in operation*. While there are other businesses in professional services (engineering, surveying, tech) that people completely miss that didn't experience any mass buying and are now returning 30%, with a b line towards significant recovery with every passing day.

Basically, my thoughts are - ride the short if you know people are going to bump the price up due to it being the 'obvious' choice for newbie traders, or just get off the train of retail/airlines etc and engage with all the other undervalued shares that will return and recover faster and are equally undervalued."	twentyversions	0

As if the share price rising means anything when almost all shares have been rising over the last month, including literally every share i purchased in early April regardless of industry. That doesn't make KMD unique, good or special."	twentyversions	0
2020-05-29	21:51:18	That is true however numbers going into a center for leisure do not equate to profits for center management. Aus retail was in a very bad place pre-COVID with heavy discounting eating into margins. There is no way these same shops are coming out of covid in better place with more money to give to landlords. Many retail chains will go broke over the next period of winter trading.	withhindsight	0

2 - Most retail shops have seen an increase in online sales and that is a revenue stream that minimises costs as opposed to a shop front.

So basically stuff is bad for ages until it gets a very brief boost, after which is falls to normal again and there is no real gain unless you cash out at the high - but even then. there are other companies in other industries that have already made significant gains that are also actually growing long term, in a very diverse and real way. They've already gained 50% in the last 2 months., which is probably the rise you'd expect on the good day for KMD.

I duno, i've got a couple mates who lost their job and they do want to travel but without a job and that security they won't be spending $200 on a jacket, they'll be grabbing some cheapy from big W.  I feel like travel gear does well in times of plenty, and not so much in a recession.

2020-05-29	08:36:45	"I won’t comment on ses, as I know nothing about it but I can help you with a few tips. Be careful with tips from reddit, you are essentially gambling with these companies.

To formulate a view read company presentations to get a basic view of the company. After this research the industry, read analyst reports, skim hot copper (but be very careful), read afr articles and search the ticker on Twitter. 

Then read it’s financials to find out if they need to raise money in the future (low on cash) or if the debts getting too much. See if the profit/cashflow is increasing and formulate a view as to where the cash flows will be in the future. Companies are valued on future cash flows divided by the time value of money. Look up all these things on investopedia if you don’t understand anything. 

You need to know everything about these companies like they are your own family run business. Please don’t waste your hard earnt money on pump and dump stocks. Especially in this market- remember the data right now looks bad.

Anyway, Follow the markets, read the afr daily, read fund reports and you’ll find the right companies but in the meantime continue with etfs"	kimjonggun	0

Recently I missed the ICR boat and bought at the peak, and I'm also in the red on SZL, FLT, and CDV.

Not entirely relevant to your question but been reading Dalios book and one of his big insights was that to get the best from MPT it is most important to add in truly uncorrelated assets.

Since all equities on the ASX for example are highly correlated, it doesn't matter much that you include a lot. You'd be better to include global indices and other asset classes like bonds, and even crypto that provide more natural diversification (and hence far higher risk reward provided you can estimate expected return distributions and covariance accurately).

Yawn behind the keyboard you can claim to be anything ... So I call BS. If you had any experience you would know that when trading online the platform takes your $$ immediately as unsettled funds and the settlement period is not that relevant unless you are skating by the skin of your teeth or dealing directly with the exchange.

How bout you prove you are a genius and give me the right answers if you really know them. You could teach me a lesson by letting me lose my money. 

But we both know that without my post and subsequent comments you would have had no idea.

2020-05-28	20:11:50	I personally don't love airline business models, high fixed costs, low margin but what really worries me is that it only made $100m of free cash flow last year and thats before a $450m lease financing payment.

Overall profitable pre-corona and I'm sure hedging of fuel prices as recent super low rates should help reduce costs into the future as operation resumes.

Leases are also an interesting point as the standards really changed recently and hence the view can look skewed when they all come onto the balance sheet"	petro292	0
2020-05-29	04:36:14	"I dont think you can say the $485m is a one off because they spent $850m in FY2017, $800m in FY2018, $800m in FY2019.

Now each year i am seeing a line item in the financing section of outflows $350-450m liabilities relating to financing-this could be both leases and bond repayments. and basically they were borrowing money each year to pay the dividend.

Add in the $1.5B of revenue received in advance + the $2.5B of loans and youd find the company will be very handicapped in the future. Especially considering how tough it will be until there is a vaccine.

I agree there are some tailwinds as well with lower costs and potentially lower competition"	illwillspills	0
2020-05-29	04:54:11	"Didn't say it was a one off at all. Just saying that a bunch is being reinvested hence the barely negative cashflow

The revenue received in advance is already a liability so it's not really an issue as it hasn't been recognised as revenue and doesn't mean the company is in a worse position or handicapped. If you look at the interim financial statements you can see the split which is leaning majorly to lease liabilities over bonds. $1.5b in loans actually (leases have now been split out under the new standard so it's easy to differentiate). I also doubt they have been taking out loans to pay dividends in saying that

Agree it will be tough but I see a better outlook for them than travel companies i.e. FLT (who I personally think could go under) and WEB who have recovered considerably better after considering their recent share issues and overall new market cap"	petro292	0
2020-05-29	06:17:28	"In relation to the revenue received in advance, they would have had to refund a lot of those flights as they were cancelled = big cash outflow. $1.5b loan from December + $1B from the NZ government, I ignored the leases for now. 

When I checked earlier it did look like they were effectively borrowing cash to pay for the dividend in the financing section of the CF statement but i could have gotten that wrong.

I agree with Web and flt. I think travel sector as a whole is a good trade for the short term on reopening hype but will eventually get crushed as reality sets in"	illwillspills	0

However, the price may already be suppressed somewhat knowing about the impending new stock. ie priced in to some degree.

Given their market cap is about 53 billion, another billion of stock on issue is not going to crash the price, and if it reinforces their financials, it gives the market some confidence making it more attractive.

 IAA has a good breakdown of the sectors in terms of what seem to be ever growing, IT(30%), Financials(28%) and communications(22.5) which  I think are good sectors for a developing economy and their top holdings are all well established and high growth companies. Tencent has always been one of my favourite tech companies in the east with how much they own in China in terms of the infrastructure and how they are growing into the west.

2020-05-26	04:50:21	"ZIPPAY is probably the more secure and safe option, as they also look at Credit Scores of users. Their market share is lower yet robust.

However as an investor, I would prefer APT, as it’s growth and potential is immense. Due to its global reach into the US and UK.

From my understanding the amount of users in USA have pretty much over taken the number of users in Aus. Due to sheer population size.

Disclaimer: I own both."	KevinBacony	0

APT and Z1P charge you fees every month your balance isn't $0, yet they mostly make their profit from exorbitant fees to businesses. Maybe I'm missing something but if I don't understand why someone would use APT or Z1P I don't feel like investing in it.	GammaScorpii	0
2020-05-26	15:18:18	"Just a thought about APT from an early investor who got out around its previous ATH. When i asked why his response was that there are concerns around expansion into America because its popular to just declare bankruptcy.  This leads to far more unpaid debts than in other territories and he sees this as being a problem for their model.

Take from it what you will not sure if its a valid concern as i havn't done any research for myself"	lou_harms	0

2020-05-25	20:21:27	They've been irrationally low then had to do an SPP. They were at a multi year high with a healthy balance sheet and decent cash flow. 2019 was slightly worse than 2018 but 2020 was going amazing prior to corona. They were at $15 in February then fell to $8 and even went down slightly. Insurance companies aren't sexy compared to afterpay so I think they've just gone under the radar.	San_Marzano	0
2020-05-25	21:48:18	Fair enough, have never dipped into insurance but it seems fairly stable long term barring the occasional disaster.

During times like these more and more businesses will be taking out insurance. Insurance companies typically aim to Breakeven on insurance claims by their clients and taking on new clients. Their money is made through their investments. Their debt to equity ratio is still very strong, return on invested capital is strong and another good sign is management buying shares at low prices.

And with giants such as Apple we are beginning to see this, with their AirPod production in Vietnam.

Bank shares are not like savings accounts in that they don't go up/down much. It is down 45% over the last 6 months.

Secondly, you don't only ""win or lose"" when you sell them. You ""win or lose"" when they go up or down in value."	kidpokeineyegif	0

2020-05-26	03:34:02	True it is down at the moment but look at the trends over years. Banks will always be around due to them being a necessary. Look at the return on investment interms of dividends, you are just simply looking at the buy and sell price because ur looking for a quick buck. A blue chip stock like a bank isnt ment to be a day trading stock if ur thinking that u probably should be looking at tech medicine other industries rather then banks because they will have larger fluctuations and explosions when there adopted. Eg afterpay tesla csl for example. Bank shares will generally give u better returns over time but in dividends. Either way bank shares and Macquarie shares are at a half price to what they are normerly at so there not bad investments.	Kallisto83	0

This is wrong because they do ""go up or down much"" (down 45% in 6 months). It is also wrong because you seem to be saying it's like a savings account because of the dividends - do you really need it spelt out why that is wrong?

You also wrote ""Remember u only win or lose when u sell them so it's just a matter of time"". You seem to be implying that the share price will recover no matter what and that no loss has been made when shares go down in price. You haven't got a realised loss, but you still have an unrealised loss and the idea that prices will always recover is wrong - NAB itself is a great example of that; try googling the price history for the last 10 years.

Basically, in your original comment I can't see anything that is correct."	kidpokeineyegif	0
2020-05-26	20:31:07	I guess it really depends on how you interpret there trends over the last 20 years it has fluctuated in price  between 20 and 40 dollars a share. And due to economic and global crisis all shares have dropped around 50% then over time they have gone back up. Nab has always generally sat around the 30 dollar mark as an average. What I am saying is the bank shares are still giving u passive income in the form of dividends and in the next 3 to 5 years it should go back up like it has previously done after gfc etc. Am I not wrong in saying u only make an official loss when u sell at a loss or if the company collapses, which is rare for a top 4 bank to do in australia. I always do look at the full timeline of a share when evaluating them and there business plan and strategy. Does shares not give an average of 5% return compared to a bank account which is 2 or 3%. I started my share portfolio in 1997 with just 10k and it's now over a million dollars with only buying shares that do dividend reinvestment and no I have not bought any more. Of which I have used the dividends to pay off my uni and 2 cars and my house deposit as well. So I apologise if you misinterpret what I am saying but I am happy and content with my share strategy. I have dropped another 10k during the dip and have already doubled my money currently and it has only been a month or so since the dip in the share market.	Kallisto83	0

2020-05-24	16:24:56	"A couple of quick thoughts: 

- DOW has 83% of its operations across in Urban Services (Transport, Utilities, Services) and is predominately based in Australia. I wouldn't say diversified. If anything seems like the company should refocus on the core. In fact it was doing a review of its mining division (potential sale) before COVID-19. Unsure on the numbers for what dilution this would have (I believe mining is around 11% of earnings). 

- The main segment it operates in is traditionally a low margin industry, so don't expect meaningful margin improvement or sales growth. DOW only achieves a 4.2% margin in FY19, an improvement on the pcp, although nothing to rave about. 

Overall the business doesn't excite me, albeit IMO core Urban Services division is likely to benefit from any increased government stimulus. I would look for contract catalysts here.

6.7% dividend yield is attractive although interim div has also been delayed (could be cancelled).

I assume most people would buy this on a mining sale and expected return to shareholders. 

My question - why buy this when you could buy some Telstra?"	athoughtfulusername	0
2020-05-24	18:21:33	"In addition to this they are also significantly increasing their portfolio in the defense sector. They are bidding and winning on major defense contracts as prime, and this is where I see their growth over the next 10-15 yrs. A lot more high margin in defense contracts and longer revenue periods will smooth out lumpy revenue in resources  sector. 

I think they would be a great buy on a 10+yr timeframe."	drunkmeerkat	0

2020-05-24	16:57:18	"Thank you for your insightful reply. 

What you say about the focus on urban services might be true, but transport, utilities and services is still a pretty broad range of operations. Good point about operating mostly in Australia, but I do hold mqg and rhc so got some overseas exposure.  I agree that explosive growth is unlikely in downer, I'm coming at it more from the angle that is seems a safe industry relatively speaking (urban areas increasingly becoming more dense and requiring more transport and utility infrastructure in Australia and NZ) and seems undervalued and oversold recently. 

Why do you recommend Telstra as an alternative? I've never really considered them because I thought of them as a strong company that seems to be very slowly losing influence. Curious to hear your thoughts."	Acetrainer333	0

How We Handle Client Assets

Client money is segregated in special bank accounts (Client Money Accounts held in Trust with Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (""ADI"")) which are designated for the exclusive benefit of Australian clients of IBKR. This segregation is a requirement of Australian Financial Services License (""AFSL"") holders and, Interactive Brokers Australia (""IBKR Australia""), as an AFSL holder, fully complies with these principles.

By properly segregating the client's assets, if no money or stock is borrowed and no futures positions are held by the client, then the client's assets are available to be returned to the client in the event of a default by or bankruptcy of the broker.

Client money is NOT invested by IBKR Australia, and is at all times held in these Client Money Accounts held in Trust. In addition, IBKR Australia does NOT hold any excess amount of its own money in these Client Money Accounts held in Trust.

2020-05-24	18:25:59	Good point on trading view. I think if you want to use the same platform for ASX and US you might need to look at something like Saxo. I might have done this instead of IB, but I am in deep with Commsec and don't really want to move all my ASX stocks. It's also worth noting you need to do $10 USD in brokerage on IB to avoid fees but I find this fairly easy, especially by doing one ASX trade/month at $6.	earlyriser83	0
2020-05-24	16:20:32	Not the money, the shares. You are not the owner of the shares, though the money is held in trust. So basically uncommitted funds will come back to you, your shares will not because they aren't owned by or registered to you.	Kyanar	0

For Australian shares, yes, absolutely you should always use a CHESS sponsoring broker (not all Australian brokers are, and some foreign brokers actually are).

[Here's the list of Settlement participants](https://www2.asx.com.au/content/dam/asx/participants/lists-of-participants/asx-settlement-participant.pdf), the ones who can actually execute a trade and sponsor your shareholding.

2020-05-24	02:16:18	"Investment is often more about comparison than absolute values. Equaling the current value of January (assuming your holdings in roughly tracked with market at the time) would actually put your holdings ahead of the current market. So from that point of view you've lost less than most other people. Everyone losing $5 and you only lose $3 could be viewed as being the same as you get $2 and every one else gets $0.

When it comes to if you should throw it into property, its become very apparent that property is not the guaranteed investment that people often envisage. Outlook on property at the moment isn't a positive one and while inertia can mean that value doesn't plummet and maybe coast through rough spots the effect of reduced liquidity and management costs are serious considerations.

Again on comparison for property or stocks, you might want to consider what is currently holding up the values of both at the moment.

1. Quantitative Easing stimulus is currently active, as that tapers off it would make sense to expect reductions on value of stocks
2. Home loan ""pause"" availability, banks are currently offering mortgage holds that pause repayments but still accumulate interest. Combined with Jobkeeper/Jobseeker payments then foreclosures or stressed sales probably aren't happening yet in large numbers. However the holds have limited life spans (6 months) as does jobkeeper/seeker and while business is starting to tick up again there's a pretty good prospect of significant populations being pushed beyond capacity for loan maintenance. At the very least I would expect landlords who have been stressed by reduced rental returns during this to be looking at reducing leverage if they own multiple properties by selling off some."

Which is ironic, because I don't know if you have been the US namesakes these brands copied.

2020-05-22	22:49:31	In China where online shopping is so prevalent, sellers as well as couriers have fierce competition. As a result, free delivery and free returns, same day delivery, and very pleasant shopping experience for consumers. Hopefully Australia can be like this some day.	pancaketoo	0

2020-05-22	18:03:36	LIC vs ETF - what's the difference and how do you calculate compounded future returns?	isthatapeanut	1
2020-05-22	20:42:01	"LICs usually have higher degrees of franking credits as they're run as an investment company in Australia paying taxes here. They are also allowed to withhold earnings to smooth out cash flow which is great if you're a retiree looking at a stable income.

ETFs don't get to withhold cap gains/dividends and it could be bad to get a chunk of income one quarter and nothing the next. 

Some other differences are management fees. Some ETFs have low fees, others have high fees and same with LICs. They also each have their own investment strategies and some suck more than others (both ETFs and LICs).

A good site I like is ETFWatch where you can check returns on ETFs/LICs and read up on more info. This will help you calculate the returns in 10 years time.

One more benefit is stuff like AFI I believe have DSSP which means you don't get dividends at all but instead it is counted as capital gains when you sell which can help if you are a high income individual. ETFs can't do this.

I've kinda gone everywhere with this but hopefully this gives you a starting point."	fishball_7204	0
2020-05-23	15:14:23	"Yeh I think there's 3 big differences 

1. LICs don't typically follow the market and pick n choose the companies to make up the fund

2. Therefore it is more active so typically have higher fees though not always significantly higher

3. DSSP is available on 2 LICs which allows for a DRP but without having to pay income tax on the dividend. Therefore, this appeals to people on higher incomes"	Azza0880	0

Real talk though. I wouldn't touch LVT right now. 

For sure, they have a huge growth prospects  and large customer base. However, they are spending increasingly large amounts of OPEX to try penetrate these customers without much success. There is also early signs of MSFT leveraging it's own inhouse capability to to target the sharepoint user interface market which would absolutely destroy LVT. 

You might think that they are a good buy right now trading on 2 to 2.5 FY21 sales but they have had shit organic customer growth. Alot of their new customers were gained from CYCL acquisition and ARR and EBIT both missed analyst estimates.

With the impact that COVID has had on companies spend, I think that LVT's product is not really a priority for most companies right now and expect to see ARR and EBIT further decrease this year."""	FlimsyDrawing9	0

2020-05-22	16:10:05	"Here's an example from [Commsec](https://www.commsec.com.au/education/learn/managing-investments/how-do-franking-credits-work.html#): 

**Case study: James receives a tax refund**

James owns shares in a company. The company pays him a fully franked dividend of $700. His dividend statement says there is a franking credit of $300. This represents the tax the company has already paid. This means the dividend, before company tax was deducted, would have been $1,000 ($700 + $300).

Come tax time, James must declare $1,000 (the $700 dividend plus the $300 franking credit) in his taxable income. If his marginal tax rate was 15%, he would have paid $150 tax on the dividend. Because the company has already paid $300 in tax, James will receive a refund of the difference, which is $150.

If James was in a higher tax bracket he may not have been entitled to a refund of any of the franking credit, he may even have to pay additional tax. However, if he is a low income earner, it is possible to be refunded the full amount of the franking credit.

2020-05-21	23:26:26	I bought some as a punt, 300% increase in online sales YOY, good discount, good capital raise, could be alright, got to risk it to get the biscuit.	agency-man	0
2020-05-21	22:35:21	I think they are looking strong especially going into winter with people holidaying in their state/aus. I also like the purchase of ripcurl and think it help them maintain solid revenue through the summer months.	trobe211	0
2020-05-21	22:08:28	At a price <$1.00 I think they are a good buy.... they make great quality hiking/outdoor gear. They have a strong brand and reputation. Their green inlay puffer jackets are on every 2nd person in Melbourne... strategically their purchase of OBOZ is what is most interesting.... oboz is a hiking boot manufacturer based in Montana. They have a great reputation in the out door hiking game in the USA. So KMD who are huge in the AUS/NZ market now have access to the USA. They can use OBOZs brand to slide into the USA market... also their acquisition in ripcurl is pretty exciting, ripcurl have an industry standard niche especially in wetsuits and beach gear... for a brand focused on outdoor, beach, surf, hiking etc culture. I think they have great potential.... your risks are of course a global recession that impacts people’s ability to spend $300 on a jacket or $700 on a wetsuit... that said they recently said their online sales are up massively.... I brought them recently with a 3-5 year hold in mind.... I think the strategic purchase of oboz and their access to the USA could be a strong long term play.	Wetrapordie	0

2020-05-21	20:19:38	"(New investor so don't know shit i'm saying) but,

KMD Currently at 0.91 and 52wk High is 2.16. 

walk down the main street in my town and you'll see a KMD jacket pretty quickly, seems like a great/popular/trendy business ATM. however Retail Seems relatively risky for an investment atm. Feel like you could get the same/better expected profits that you're going for by looking at some different businesses/industries? 

Some interesting ones i've found from this and other subs are - BKW, NEA, ADN, CSL, 

But i guess if fashion is an intrest and you're passionate about KMD, could be the one for you?"	Aleckrandall	0
2020-05-21	20:25:43	"I think if you allow 2-3 years they will be stronger then where they started. 

They have improved the online sales and now those customers have online accounts with the company to make further spending easier.

Most of their revenue comes for Aus and NZ which is doing better then the rest of the world. 

Increased domestic travel over the next 2 years including camping and local snow fields. Expected wetter weather compared to previous winters. I don't think we will be open for international travel til maybe even 2022.

They have raised capital and are secure for the mean time. 

Short term, I don't know how quick they rise but I believe mid-term they will do great."	FurcationInvolvement	0

2020-05-22	02:21:49	I have seen a lot of new investors talk about KMD and I thought I might give you some of my experiences since I have been trading for a long time and have grown 10k to over 1 mil without selling only via reinvestment. KMD max was $3.00 and now its say 90c ish. So even if you got a x3 multiplier. Yes they do dividend reinvestment so it's not to bad but you also gotta consider competition local and international and online. Unless your spending big $$ where you will really notice the impact the return will have but it sounds like a lot of you are putting 500 to 1k in KMD. I would recommend thinking broader at what the world relies on no matter the season whether the economy is good or bad. Especially for those people that are buy and holders. This advice does not apply to day traders, but keep in mind if u sell before a year holding u pay normal cgt tax. If you hold longer then a year j get a reduction.	Kallisto83	0
2020-05-22	11:34:56	If you ask me I think the business is undervalued atm but not by much, they have a good balance sheet with no short term debt, they now owned Rip curl as well so it isn't just a winter clothing brand and we already know everyone's more inclined to travel domestically when the restriction ease so we might see a small spike in the hiking/camping industry who knows. Just don't forget their shares are diluted after the recent equity raise and right now it's still a big uncertainty for the retail industry. Be your own judge	911Blue	0

2020-05-22	00:46:14	"Ive posted alot on KMD recently.
Not trying to pump, just think it's severely mispriced. 

A comment I made a few weeks ago.

""Pre Corona price of around $2.40. Currently trading at $0.88. This is way too cheap IMO.
Obviously retail hit hard but I think we will be back to relative normality soon (at least with regards to travel within ANZ)
I would expect an uptick in outdoor activities like hiking etc post corona so can see KMD benefiting massively from this.
Balance sheet is strong so short term cash flow issues shouldn't be an issue. Risk comes around corona causing structural changes to retail. But even then at the high price point of KMD I think they will be safer than other retailers"""	FlimsyDrawing9	0

2020-05-22	22:56:25	"I am still a somewhat of a beginner but here are some lessons I have learn in relation to your post. 

1. I have come to learn that there is a futility in picking individual stocks and holding long term as opposed to index/ETF investing. According to Buffett 99% of investors should not even attempt to beat the market by picking individual stocks as it's extremely unlikely that you will be able to beat the market over time. I personally wish I had put more into ETFs earlier rather than individual stock picking. So if I was starting out I would buy into a couple of ETF's as my long term holds rather than looking for individual stocks. Over time as you gain more experience you can then begin to set aside a portion of your portfolio e.g 20% (depending on your apetite for risk) which you can invest in individual stocks if you wish. 
2. Always consider the nuances of a point of view and challenge your assumptions. As an example... you think KMD will see a short term spike as winter is coming... that sounds logical to me however what about the counterpoint to that... what if a huge majority of potential customers just wear their winter clothing from last year and see no need to buy an expensive KMD jacket? That could see KMD's sales for the quarter plummet significantly compared to last year. Also if this is a short term hold then you could set a price or a set of circumstances that you want to occur before you sell. 

All the best."	taxidriver99	0
2020-05-22	01:36:01	I was a young investor just like you and I have done extremely well just from a bit of advice I got when I was younger from my parents and family friends. Turned 10k to over 1 million today and by just doing blue chips and letting them build via reinvestment. CBa and banks are good as long as you are doing dividend reinvestment but think of them like a savings account. My mum always said look at things people will always need now and in the future.. thus medicines and banks.. because no matter whether good times or bad times they will always be needed. I invested another 10k in the dip and hoping in 5 to 10 years to make a lot more. A handy book is barefoot investor which is good for all aspects of saving investment and planning	Kallisto83	0
2020-05-22	02:04:56	I had a look at KMD but I still dont understand what the wow is with Kathmandu shares or am I just crasy. If you look at overall performance there not that huge they barely went past $3 a Share. So even if u bought it say 90 cents it's only a x 3 multiplier. However there is lots of other competitors in that industry and they have to compete with online and local sales too so it's hard for them to maintain dominance. I guess it just depends on how much you are investing. Since u bought them already hold for over a year to reduce the cgt tax component. But I would look into other shares with greater potential.

Continuing to sign significant sized new contacts with hospitals both locally and internationally. Strong management with high inside ownership (skin in the game).

Take a look at their results and announcements at the end of April for a recent summary and snapshot:

Transaction costs are likely to make it unprofitable though, depending.   


Also, don't forget, if you have an entitlement under the SPP then you already actually own the underlying stock. Just sell it at 10 and collect your SPP stock at 9, that's fine.

2020-05-21	02:28:51	Not quite true mate. - an SPP placement is an entitlement only available to small scale retail investors, and, in limited amounts. The big boys don't get it.

Even if the share price doesn't drop to placement price - that's likely due to the limited supply, hence a premium. 

Happy to be proven wrong if there's an arb opportunity atm, but there's no guarantee of any SPP fill - you'd probs be able to make a similar profit (with similar risk) by buying into the spp at 30k and selling."	akkatracker	0

2020-05-21	08:16:18	"Yeah - we are talking about the same thing, akkatracker, I think from different angles.   


I'm talking about most placements, which tend to have an insto component and a retail SPP component.   


Yes,  the share price will generally adjust to reflect the placement; but once the insto placement has finished, and all that is left is the retail SPP, you have a situation where the retail investor can buy in on terms and prices that instos cannot, BUT, those prices are only available to small investors, and for relatively small dollars. Options pricing is going to be largely determined by the instos. So it's not inconceivable that arb opportunities could exist for retail holders that don't exist for insto. But they will be small and pissy if they do exist.   


And as you say, yes, no guarantee of an SPP fill, and, yes, why bother with a short options contract when you actually own the underlying already, and can just sell that."	Minimalist12345678	0
2020-05-21	17:57:38	Nope, especially when there's such a heavy discount, you'll get scaled back (often quite dramatically) - so you may put in 15k and only get 2k stocks and 13k refunded.	akkatracker	0

You are spot on! I had that FOMO feeling as soon as I started seeing prices going up. On top of that I used Market orders instead of Limit therefore bought at a higher price I was expecting. Now I use limit orders and set them usually slightly lower to current price. Hope you were able to keep those stocks and they have recovered by now or do eventually"	paus20	0

So I guess this company is on the cusp of either revolutionising air and water treatment or failing due to the lack of knowledge regarding the tech.

The tech is based on free radical generation of hydroxyl groups (ozone generation is not the desirable outcome).  


Anyways, I also feel like it's a gamble. Just these small things make me wonder if it's a scam or something. I read through the patents, they seem pretty average/unofficial, but knowledgable. They have registered the patent now in multiple countries, Europe, Asia and currently awaiting approval in Australia.

My thoughts were- virgin collapses or rebrands, they’re not going to be in the air for 6months which equals downside. why bother using them if there is no competition and you could just do Jetstar and book directly. I guess flight centre there will always be people that don’t want to book online. However once baby boomers are gone, that will change. Second massive wave - we all become zombies working online from home, everyone just books direct/no one travelling.

If you’re feeling like you want to play it Texas style and go big I’m pretty sure CEO WEB bought 2million worth recently.

2020-05-19	05:58:52	"You've asked for an argument so here is one: No it isn't!

  1. That 30% housing drop is considered a possible worst-case scenario, just like your house going underwater in a 1/100 year flood, which may also be possible, but I wouldn’t bet on it. Things are looking pretty good now as businesses are opening

2. If China sentiment is the worst it has ever been, then it can only get better, right? Nothing to see here.

3. They are also unsustainable over the long term, the good thing is that global dependency is relatively easy to understand and price in

4. Yet I can draw an upwards trend on the ASX all ordinaries right through the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, where the world was facing nuclear Armageddon

5. If the world has a nuclear war, I'd be more worried about the vegetables in my garden than my retirement fund

6. See 4

7. I think at this point anyone educated knows that corona virus will never be eradicated, it was never the intention to eradicate the virus in Australia anyway. In some ways we are now victims of our own luck. Borders will open, there will be more cases, it is still a long road ahead, the market knows this. The advantage is that now we are very good at controlling outbreaks

8. Nobody is counting on a vaccine; it’s generally considered very unlikely one can be made

9. We have just had a market crash, interest rates being low is fantastic for the economy

10. So what? People buying stuff and clearing out shelves is bad for the economy how? It sucks for people’s day to day lives, yes

11. Jobkeeper will be binned at the right time. I cannot say it’s been great, but it definitely helped vulnerable people out. Jobseeker has gone on for a very long time in Australia, and was due for an increase to stimulate spending, which it now has. Another win for the economy."	3oclockam	0
2020-05-19	02:23:01	"Mmm not so sure.

We'd need another big hit before this pinata is gonna break open an shower us with red.

OPEC price war we had really helped us along this timeline, but we'd need another big unexpected global shock to move us out of our current holding pattern.

While I am playing devil's advocate here, my post is meant to point out how baseless OP's reasons are, seems like you agree that it is ridiculous. The trade tarriff on Barley may be a turning point for relations with China, noting that the tariff is not completely baseless from China's point of view, and Australia's agricultural stakeholders have been calling on the government for years to prevent this tariff from occurring. The fact that it has happened now is not a coincidence, but it is not as reactionary as people and the media would have you believe it is.

From what I have read on here and other investment boards, the sentiment is that the current low interest rates are bad for banks. With the release of the latest jobless figures it seems unlikely that the RBA will be increasing interest rates in the near future, so bank earnings will be lower for some time.

There is also a perception that NAB has a higher proportion of business loans than the other Big 4 and so is likely to have more defaults and bad debts as a result of businesses going broke during the pandemic."	Mifftup	0

When oOh! bought Adshel, they probably paid way too much but they kind of had to, to stop APN at the time. Now there are really only 4 players... QMS, oOh!, APN and GOA (brisbane) 

They still have the founder/Brendon Cook at the helm with him canceling plans of stepping down.

2020-05-20	15:22:06	"*Hey hoping someone can see this and lend a voice! just didn't want to create another post.* 

**I'm Wondering if i should continue to use Comsec or try out ComsecPocket.**

**INFO** \- I'm 21, working part time. Plan on adding NDQ into my Portfolio. Long Term hold, No plans on withdrawing till 10-30 years. At the moment I save roughly $600/month of my pay to invest. I'm Planning on investing into NDQ Monthly or quarterly, yet to decide. 

Just Seems like the $2 brokerage fee seems a better option at the moment than the comsec $10 if i'm only investing $600-2400 per trade. But in the long-run when i'm collecting profits, will the brokerage end up screwing me? or will i just have to smartly withdraw the money? (maybe withdraw in smaller portions).

Thank-you in prior to any advice given!"	Aleckrandall	0

Selfwealth puts them at 12% overvalued today.

With China threatening trade with Aus due to covid19 inquiry and with USA v China trade war threats I think FMG could be affected if things go sour.

I currently down own any and aren't going to buy right now, but I'm watching because they are a respectable and profitable company."	Yes_Here_I_Am	0
2020-05-20	23:22:10	"If you're concerned about larger brokerage costs when you sell, buy it with commsec pocket if that's possible and then when you are no longer adding to it, transfer your HIN and shares to SelfWealth or an alternative low brokerage broker and sell any amount for $9.50.

2020-05-25	06:05:31	I was in the same situation. I went with pocket as I'm over individual shares, now opting to go with ETFs only. Sure pocket is limited but it's good enough for me and $20 brokerage means I'll need to buy $10,000 parcels to have the same brokerage as pocket. Only con with pocket is the limited selection.	mrminivee	0

2020-05-25	06:24:28	"Not planning anytime soon but I'd just withdraw all of it. Going with dividend reinvestment as don't need the cash. 

It would only cost an extra $2 to withdraw, let's say $10,000 from pocket. I guess if you're investing over $25,000 then pocket is not for you."	mrminivee	0

2020-05-18	01:11:09	I’ve been using stake. Buy / sell shares as much as you want and won’t pay a cent. Only pay on deposit and withdrawal of funds from the stake account. Takes around 48 hours for your funds to appear. Unless you pay a small fee for express deposit. Uses poli payments.	d1m3r	0

2020-05-18	01:10:31	Yes, the website is clunky but the fees are cheap and you can do pretty much anything on their site. I left Stake for them and it's definitely an upgrade, particularly as I like investing in penny and TSE stocks.	earlyriser83	0

2020-05-18	19:36:20	"If you did 4 trades on Commsec of 10k each in a year to add to a buy and hold portfolio, that would at today's exchange rate cost you AU$204.16 (US$131.62).

In the above case, you would still be better using IB. Also, if your equity holdings/cash is greater than US$100k there is no fee."	ploxxx	0
2020-05-18	14:01:09	It’s really not “massive.” US$0.70 per AUD$100 and no brokerage. Commsec is 0.60% (USD) transaction fee + USD$30 for trades up to USD$10k	vBocaj	0

2020-05-18	00:40:29	"They charge USD70c per $100 converted from AUD to USD. The spot rate for conversion is very competitive. 

The basic free platform gives you free trades and fractional shares so is good for most users. 

There is also the same fee on conversion back from USD to AUD if you decide to cash out. 

Dividends are paid direct into account and you can just re invest them with the free brokerage. 

The pricing makes sense unless you are trading large amounts at which point the flat CommSec fee might work out cheaper. 

If you sign up I can give you a referral and we both get free stock in either Nike, Dropbox or GoPro. 

Overall it works for me.

Support also seems to be decent and the team are pretty responsive."	lifeDNP	0

2020-05-18	21:40:52	"One of my Metrics is to determine companies who have low levels of debt, or if they have debt how much equity would they have left over ""Net Debt to Equity"". I then like the companies to have a roe, eps, of 20% per year.

I extract this from my brokers website and just input the data into excel.

Formula for EquityNet Profit Abnormal / Return on Equity %

Formula for Net Debt to EquityTotal Debt Industrial - Cash Industrial / Equity

Once I have the data I filter companies who would the highest Net Debt to Equity.

I later filter out metrics how long they have been in the market, when was their last highs and lows, are they going to reach back to their high again, generally most will loose it's value, what are their competitors, etc. Out of 2000 something stocks, I have narrowed to 36 stocks with capitalization of 100 million and below 100 million I have narrowed it to 8 that I am interested in.

Once I have got the companies I am interested in I head over to their balance sheets.

Generally I would like to see a company that's only been a few years in the market with the same metrics but hard to find either that they have no competitive space or just speculative.  


There are companies out there charging $100 bucks a month to filter out certain data's which you can obtain in seconds. But if your cheap like me it will take you a hour or so..."	bitzeroone	0

No one knows what the price will be the next minute, hour, day etc. What I know is that capitalism and businesses will thrive, if it doesn't than everything will fail.

2020-05-16	23:02:44	"Counter point:

Money spent on job keeper saves money from job seeker.

The only reason job keeper is so high ($1500) is so that businesses keep people on until business booms open again. If job keeper wasn’t there or wasn’t so high people would have lost their jobs or quit so they can go on job seeker instead.

Low income earners who only ever made $200 a week are now $1300 better off, more money to spend and save. But most importantly - the business doesn’t pay a cent in operating costs to keep those people on the books.

Not to mention, many of those people would be entitled to rent and mortgage concessions during the downturn... or are just living with their parents still.

What does a teenager do with a spare $1300 a fortnight? Save a bunch and buy LCD TVs, gaming consoles and booze.

My guess is that the worse case scenario is that business doesn’t boom open, but trickles in and that job keeper ends and leaves people underemployed until business booms again. (Fortunately they’ve had a spare $1300 per fortnight saved up to get them through).

A whole lot of them are 20 - 35ish (theres stats on this which i cbf finding right now) please feel free to google yourself. And when both jobkeeper and jobseeker get cut (if they dont decide to slowly wind it back) and also if restrictions havent been fully lifted so that business can straight away boom again then you get
1. Businesses that are no longer getting jobkeeper and cant afford to catch up on their rent, pay workers, pay initial outlays to get started again.
2. People that if they have lost their jobs will lose jobseeker of 1500 and have to apply for the normal dole and that takes time and then they will have to try and afford their rent food etc with far less money.
They will have no money to push into the economy and the businesses that need helping back on their feet.

2020-05-17	17:07:21	"The reason that figure is so low is because job keeper is allowing businesses to continue to pay their employees to basically sit on their hands because restrictions have made them basically unable to operate and turn a profit.
When that gets removed the businesses that have been able to keep these people employed will no longer be able too.

Now that last part is speculation and is going to be determined by a few things;

1. If restrictions are 100% removed before the removal of jobkeeper than they will have a chance to get back on their feet

2. If restrictions arnt removed they have to try and catch up on their rent for the premises while trying to operate at a lesser capacity

3. Plus the original outlay of buying back in ingredients and other materials to get back underway

4. Plus they might need to hire more staff after laying some off to go back to full operations.

If they cant afford to do those things and if restrictions arnt removed that equates to more layoffs

Once more layoffs happen (and no jobseeker payment) then ordinary people cant afford to pay rent, keep food on the table etc means less spending and money injected into the economy to get it back off the ground.

The middle class of which most of this will affect make up for most of the population.
If they arnt spending then other businesses cant afford to keep going than more businesses close, more layoffs and the whole jenga pile comes tumbling down.

Again this is my personal opinion based on different bits of info ive gathered from news articles and statistics over the last few months and not necessarily fact."	DaNeeDaVeeDoh	0

What they have is a non-significant result from a proof or concept trial. Sample size was too small to give any definitive results. As someone who used to work in the biotech/ pharma industry I can assure you that their ""promising result"" is based on very little reproducible evidence. They are likely talking up their formulation to increase capital gathering, which is very common in the industry. Either way it will be many weeks/ months before they get back any results from their RCT and many more months before they can conduct larger late phase trials. If you really want to get on board, I would hold off for a few weeks for the stock price to depreciate before buying in, just before they're scheduled to release the results of their most recent trial.

TA is just a tool, no one who actually uses TA thinks its magic and is always accurate. All it does is if used well help identify trends and support/resistance levels where buyers and sellers are strongly concentrated at. And for people who think it doesnt mean anything, if enough people believe in it then it has value for one and two, most corporate advisories (Like GTT Ventures) and brokers use it.

I invested in afterpay mid 2018 it was about 9 dollars at the time. Sold out at around 20 and made a bundle. The downside is it's now valued at double that, also I was investing very little at the time (was still at uni) compared to what I am now. 

I don't regret it though. I was inexperienced at the time (still kind of am, but less so) and made the mistake of buying into hype. I could have made more, but personally there's no way I'd buy into afterpay at the current price, so I'll take my profit and run."	Acetrainer333	0

2020-05-15	16:39:25	"My biggest success: Sirtex, bought at $3.80, sold half at \~$40 (I actually picked the top of the market) and the other half at $33 (although it did take 8 years or so, so perhaps isnt the best). 

To balance things - biggest loss: company called FTT, bought at 1c. Went up to 7c as at the day before its Phase 3 trial results. Which it failed and went from 7c to .3c  within the first hour of trading...

My best short term one was a share that went from 0.6c to 2.4c within a week of me buying. So out at (from memory) about 1.8c average. 

In micro caps you get these huge swings all the time. Had a share - cant remember the prices exactly - that I had owned for a while and had dropped from about 8c purchase price to about 2c. But a rumour went around and it shot up to 14c over about 3 days, and I sold out as fast as I could. Dropped back down to 5c a week or two later.  Of course, have other shares which never had the rumour explosion and you sell out at the 2c level

I play around with micro caps with a pretty small proportion of my portfolio. To be honest, over 10 years I doubt I've come out even, but its fun.  And it also makes you realise that picking stocks outside the top, say ASX 40, is either gambling or a lot of hard work and time."	Karmaflaj	0

2020-05-16	14:20:07	This is an old one. I was 19 at the time in 2008 and interested in investing. Smack bang in the middle or the GFC... this investment was actually a hot tip from a mate who got the hot tip from someone else... the business was CUS customers limited. They made, leased and maintained ATM machines.. they had contracts with most the big banks. They were trading at around $0.10 a share which is were I brought in. I only had $500 at the time as I was working part time fresh out of high school. Anyway the hot tip was that the industry has been lobbying to get ATM fees deregulated. Meaning the ATM owners could charge whatever they wanted, think $2 atm fees! Customers with their leasing agreements would greatly benefit from this reg change... the stocks went from $0.10 to like $1.10 in a couple of days in December 2008. I sold in 2010 for around $11,000 at $2 something a share. From memory they peaked at around $3... anyway they dug their own grave. The $2 atm fees customers hated, it was in the early 2010s when smart phone and app technology was blowing up and customers moved away from cash to digital baking. Pretty sure they went to the wall and delisted in like 2013.... but yeah, a once in a lifetime 20 bagger from a hot tip off a mate... if only I had more than $500 at the time...the best part my mate that told me about it, didn’t buy. I still rub it in his face to this day.	Wetrapordie	0

With the money I bought RSG at 65c and sold them at 90c. Generally I plan to hold for 10 years and I never wanted to sell but this whole dip has been totally weird. On the down side I bought MOA (NZX) at 44c and I thought they were going to go under during lockdown so I sold them at 13c and cut my losses (they're at 18c at the mo).

2020-05-15	16:13:45	"At any given time there are at least a few companies going up by massive amounts. That's what I was drawn to when I first started investing, but it is very high risk. With a lot of these hype companies, you could make massive profits or have the price plummet and never recover. If you want to ""trade the story"" (buying and selling stocks based on anticipating hype buying and panic selling, rather than the fundamental worth of the company) go to hotcopper. I personally would not recommend this approach, however, as it is essentially gambling. 

&#x200B;

If you want to invest in more gradual growth, go to marketindex list of the asx 200 (or 100, or 300, whatever), look in a sector you like, have a look at the company's net income growth, p/e, balance sheet, their recent reports (available on the asx website under that company's ticker, e.g. CBA for commonwealth bank), search the company name and look on the google news tab to get recent news, search ""company name scandal"" and see if anything comes up that would concern you, go on simply wall street and look at the snowflake analysis for the company, then look at the more specific details on anything that interests you. 

&#x200B;

Nobody is going to tell you which stocks to buy, and anyone who does is someone you should be extremely cautious of (there are lots of people who essentially shill and talk up their own holdings to drive up demand and therefore price, especially with micro cap stocks on hotcopper). One reason this sub can be hostile to new investors is that people will come essentially asking ""what's a great stock that I can be guaranteed huge returns on with no risk"". And the answer is, essentially, nothing, at least nothing that is common knowledge. Any such stock would be bought so heavily that it would be overpriced very quickly. The mantra of this sub and investors in general is do your own research. I outlined part of my research process above, yours might be different, and that's fine. I like discussing stocks on here, but you should use online forums as a starting point, not an absolute justification for a buy. 

&#x200B;

Sorry for the essay, I don't know you but just the fact you said you're at uni with a part time job you remind me of my situation a couple of years back, just wanting to get into investing. I made a lot of early investor mistakes (e.g. buying the big hype stock APT without researching enough) and they actually netted me profit through essentially dumb luck. If you make the same mistakes you might not be as lucky.

2020-05-15	16:04:35	The significance of the numbers changes with each industry/sector, but a good place to start is to go to the companies website, pull out their financial statements for the past 5 or 10 years and workout their growth rates. I.e is their revenue growing at a consistent rate, or at all from year to year, what about their net assets, their cash at the end of the period etc etc. That's a pretty good start.

&#x200B;

What would you say is a fair valuation in your eyes?

&#x200B;

Did you see how much equity it has?

Read through the balance sheet and the cash flows, then come back and say it's over valued.

The growth on this stock is \*\*insane\*\*. You're also not looking forward into the future for APT (which is what you're meant to do for mid cap stocks), which at this rate is extremely bright.

&#x200B;

If the only down side you have is ""they run at a loss"" - then maybe you need to change the way you read company financials.

&#x200B;

As for P/E ratio, perhaps read up on Mark Minervini's strategy on high PE stocks particularly for 'newer' companies like APT. While other people run, he buys into those up-trending high p/e ratio stocks and makes a killing.

Low P/E stocks are low for a reason, not because ""it's a bargain"". I strongly suggest you don't look at high P/E as a bad thing.

&#x200B;

Mark M: ""

Wall Street has little idea what P/E ratio to put on companies growing  at huge rates. It’s extremely difficult, if not impossible, to predict  how long a growth phase will last and what level of deceleration will  occur over a particular time frame when one is dealing with a dynamic  new leader or new industry.

&#x200B;

Many superperformance stocks tend to move to extreme valuations and  leave analysts in awe as their prices continue to climb into the  stratosphere in spite of what appears to be a ridiculous valuation. **\*\*Missing  out on these great companies is due to misunderstanding the way Wall  Street works and therefore concentrating on the wrong price drivers\*\***

One thing I will add in addition to what the article stated was that Afterpay is also gaining access to key pieces of information that should not be underestimated. That is actual spending patterns across a very broad range of retailers of their customers in addition to their customers’ ages, addresses, likes/dislikes etc. 

I would imagine in the fine print that they are able to mine this data or possibly even sell it to other service providers or retailers should they wish. Or even use it to target their customers in a very strategic way. 

It’s almost like it is the Amazon of BNPL. Retailers really have no choice but to get on the bandwagon but by doing so they give up their customers precious personal data to a third party - Afterpay. I think I was reading about it being referred to as the “leaky bucket effect”. 

For those who have made mention of Amazon previously and all the naysayers, remember Amazon started out selling books online. Nothing very exciting or original about that. Sometimes the simplest ideas are often the best."	TakeBetsBreakNecks	0

2020-05-14	21:08:07	Interesting read! It sounds great in those terms... what are your thoughts around disruption? Conceptually it’s a pretty basic business concept. They already have half a dozen competitors in Australia. What’s stopping a big player like Visa or someone from coming in and offering a similar product and undercutting Afterpay on merchant fees. Afterpay already have a brand advantage as the article points out they are a Verb! That alone is worth something. I take the point around the price is set with the view they will be profitable in a few years, what is their advantage over all the other BNPL firms out there... I think they are a good company and I’d probably price them now at $10-12 on book value and maybe $18-$20 forecasting future growth. I don’t get the $43 price tag and $11.5 billion valuation. That’s very confident of future earning power.	Wetrapordie	0

2020-05-15	01:40:05	"Telsa isn’t the same, the auto industry will be consolidated in the future into only a handful of manufacturers much like mobile phones where, when iPhone came out. There’s not enough space for the required r&d for multiple self driving operating systems. Many manufactures won’t even have the capital to switch their manufacturing from ICE to EV.

Beyond that, they’re the worlds largest manufacturer of batteries and have quite a large moat around that. If the future is renewables, that power has to be stored somewhere and it’s most likely going to be in Tesla (or one of a select few other brands) batteries.

Sure on paper now Tesla doesn’t seem like a great investment, but people are buying into it because of potential futures earnings.

People are buying Afterpay because they think unregulated pay day loans to people who don’t have $150 is the future of banking....apparently."	j03l5k1	0

Hey random seperate question. Considering your background in e-commerce and start ups. Did you see the Octopus deal that Origin Energy made. They brought a 20% stake in a small Uk based energy start up, to get access to this digital platform they built called kraken. It sounds like a really interesting deal. They paid $500 million for it. I haven’t found anyone who understands the tech enough to decipher if it’s a good play. Origin state it will cut $150 mil a year out of back of office operating expenses as this kraken platform seems to have 100% automated their billing platform."	Wetrapordie	0
2020-05-14	22:19:01	"I work for a three-lettered competitor and I’ve commented about this deal previously. 

The energy market is extraordinarily complicated and a lot of a company’s revenue comes from energy trading rather than customer usage. There is a massive amount of data involved too. 

Smart meters will start to send their usage at 5 minute increments and the energy trading market is moving to a 5 minute settlement model. All of this means that the big players in the energy market will need to invest heavily in IT systems in order to maintain their seat at the table. 

The traditional players, SAP and Oracle are just as expensive to purchase and customise. The winner in this space will be the company who can best predict supply/demand behaviour. The only thing better than predicting supply and demand is controlling it - which is why you’ll see virtual power plants becoming a lot more prominent. 

Like I said, it’s a complex area that isn’t well understood."	HonestCondition8	0

Holding 3 stocks is certainly moving up the curve - your risk is higher, and, your potential returns are likely higher.   


But as people say, it is most likely that you are over-inflating your own abilities (nothing personal, everyone does this, its just how our brains are wired) and you don't actually have a greater level of skill at picking stocks than anyone else."	Minimalist12345678	0
2020-05-15	17:38:53	Statistically they're right though (being right on 3 is easier than being right on 20), but the point is you don't need to be right with all 20 stocks to be in the green.	akkatracker	0
2020-05-15	21:01:33	"Other way around, you're more likely to have been correct about 2 or 3 stocks than 15 or 20, but also more likely to have been catastrophically wrong about 2 or 3 than 15 or 20.

If every stock is simplified to a coin flip and you allocate your investments evenly, if you invest in just 2 stocks you have a 25% chance of going bust and a 25% chance of doubling your money. For 30 stocks you're going to stay roughly neutral. A bull market, over a long period, means that coin flip is 51% in your favour, so diversifying guarantees returns while picking a few stocks still has a chance of awful returns.

If you think you know a lot about a couple of stocks, 80% in ETFs and 20% in satellites gives you a bit of both worlds.

The overall idea is that in most people's life situations, being given $500k isn't substantially better than being given $200k, when compared with how much worse it is to lose $100k or be given $0k. To demonstrate it another way, let's say right now I offer you a dice roll that you're only allowed to play once. If you roll a 3/4/5/6 you double your money, if you roll a 1/2 you lose it. How much of your portfolio do you put in? 100%? 0%? 50%? It's dependent on your current financial situation, not just profitability. Picking stocks is a gentler version of that dice roll."	9fences	0
2020-05-15	18:14:59	"This is what I have trouble grasping though. If I've gotta do my homework before investing, 3 is reasonable, 20 is a full time job that's inevitably going to lead to cutting corners, skimming, and missing the red flags you'd pick up on when you can devote more time to it.  
I agree that picking stocks doesn't work in relation to the short term pricing of the share, but the long term prospects of a company, over a long enough period of time for its success to be reflected in its price? Surely you're better knowing all there is to know about a few companies you invest in and can monitor their environment closely, than just having the gist of a bunch of them and saying ya win some ya lose some."

They're probably quoting Buffett, whilst at the same time betting against him, so it'll be interesting to see what happens.

Low interest rates definitely got something to do with it. But, I think it's the possibly of dividends getting cut, along with the share price drops, that's really spooking the crowd.

Just look at the European & Japanese banks with their negative interest rates.

Low interest rates, reduced/cutting dividends, huge provisions, along with the fact that we've reported ridiculously high unemployment numbers, verging on a recession... damn right you better be scared if you own banks.

But... they've already fallen like 40%? or so from their highs... how much further could they fall? 50%, if shit really hits the fan.

2020-05-14	18:02:52	Opinions on QAN right now?	nathanius_rex	1
2020-05-14	18:24:47	Because it’s still trading 3x higher than a point in time which it was actually flying. It’s just fomo lineup going there right now. International travel isn’t coming back in 2020 and some are sharing perhaps not until 2023 and when it does come back it will be staggered country by country. There will be no V shaped recover for airlines. QAN wil be safe long term but it’s a dog shit stock until perhaps Q3/4 at least (pending no vaccine breakthrough or cure). There most expensive assets (widebody aircraft) still need to be paid off and they’re just sitting around depreciating, yet still needing to be maintained and flight ready. These are specified for filling haul international flights and they’re very expensive paperweights atm. It’s They’ll probably need government bailout as they only have 6 months of money.	j03l5k1	0

2020-05-15	23:39:01	"Yes PMGOLD is technically a call option but this is a fine print thing and not all that meaningful. The point is that for every unit you buy is physically backed and redeemable at the Perth Mint for 1/100 oz of gold. The gold is stored onshore, guaranteed by the WA government and is redeemable at any time. GOLD is held in vaults offshore (London), not guaranteed by government and more difficult to redeem the physical metal. So for Australians PMGOLD is safer, and that important for precious metals since security is the reason people invest in them. 

Yes the management fee is weird but still cheap, if you hold more than $6k it is the same effective fee as GOLD and after that its all gravy. If you are a small time punter (<$6k) who just wants to gamble on the price and will never take delivery then GOLD is better because of the fee, otherwise I don't see why I should pick that over PMGOLD."	josh__ab	0
2020-05-16	07:39:32	Oh this mostly answers my next question about Perth Mint! Thanks. Is this better than buying real gold? Just for arguments sake I wanted to invest $10kz	higgeldypiggeldy1	0
2020-05-16	13:00:19	"I wouldn't say its necessarily better than physically owning the gold where you can touch it since that is the ultimate form of security  (you have complete 100% control and no global crisis or government collapse can cause you to lose it). Sure PMGOLD is probably the safest paper gold you can buy but people often like being able to touch it with complete sovereignty in their private collection .

But owning it yourself means you got to buy the gold, pay to have your bars/coins minted, pay for delivery and then you need to find a very very safe space to store it. It will take around a week or two (in most places) from the initial ordering to when its gets to you so theres that as well. Also to sell it down the track will also have fees.

PMGOLD lets you buy gold without the ""hassle"" of physical ownership and gives you the option to take physical ownership later down the line. And you can buy/sell it on the ASX only paying brokerage and the low management fee.

So basically that long post was just a way of saying its up to you whether its better than physical gold or not. Even if you want physical you can buy PMGOLD just to redeem it shortly thereafter."	josh__ab	0

Long term really like the story, they had some one-offs in the half year which if you adjust for they did about $2m in the 1H which annualises to about 10x earnings. Very cheap for the growth. Balance sheet is also very strong, plenty of cash to get through any short term weakness."	Wini9	0

2020-05-13	20:55:55	"If you could have bought in at $0.90 before trading was halted in anticipation of this announcement, you could have profited this morning when trading resumed at $1.20. However, if you didn’t get in early, you would have lost money because it’s highest price today was the opening price (more or less). It’s been down hill since then. 

This is a big gamble for REX, with them pretty much hoping to be to the Virgin collapse what Virgin was to the Ansett collapse. I.e. the small airline waiting on the sidelines to jump in and provide much needed capacity when the big airline falls over. 

That relies on Virgin actually collapsing, of course. Because while Virgin and Qantas are ready to fly there will be overcapacity for some time."	Kitty015	0

I don’t think you know what an ETF is. To be 100% clear: investing in VDHG is investing in the Australian and US indexes. You aren’t buying a company. 

Is your problem with the US and Australian stock market index?

VDHG returned 3.08% over the last two years. Yeah it's not amazing but pandemic blah blah blah and it's not 0. For reference VGS returned 4.45% over the same period.

KMD is a solid brand with favourable financials. I see them recovering in the long-term but they will struggle until then.  


WEB is as stated by many before me a risky move but has decent assets to survive through a first and second wave of infections. Their PE, PER, and PB ratios are all in the green. I don't think that they will deliver in the long run but they are a strong short given the interest in them.   


Either way, I wouldn't expect any meaningful dividends from either of these companies over the next two years. 

NDQ is a great ETF but you will currently be buying near the top of the market so don't expect any COVID-related discount. It might pay to see the DOW drop a few hundred more points before you commit.

2020-05-13	00:54:14	"FLT and KMD. Very unusual choices for your sole AUS shares if I was to be completely honest. Both have potential, albeit for different reasons.  


KMD is obviously well positioned at that price point. They have great assets (other than rip curl) and a solid brand.  


FLT is at best a mid-term hold. I do not see them as a strong long-term performer what with their antiquated business model, decreasing market cap, and shrinking target demographic. I'd put my money into WEB over FLT, far better prospects.   


I would  suggest staying away from individual international stocks given that you are new to this. If anything keep investing in AUD-hedged ETFs which cover international markets. Far less hassle. US airlines are incredibly risky given the unique and highly competitive market. I'd suggest QAN but you are already invested in FLT so you might benefit from additional diversification."		0

I. A bear market like we just had is a once a decade opportunity to purchase blue chip stocks cheaply. Why own FLT when you can own SYD?

II. I only buy ETFs when it comes to global equities because there are too many markets to watch otherwise. With such a small amount of capital available to you, they provide a good way to diversify.

Why is Boeing on your list? Flying is going to be reduced for the next few years, at least and no one wants to order a new plane in at least that time and even longer.  If you are so focused on these sort of ""rebound"" stocks, have a look at something like Disney or Marriott.

Very true, however the competitive market usually offers a much higher return than domestic market options.

It's so infuriating watching that sometimes where there's twice as many people trying to buy at a certain price as there are sellers trying to go above it, and these weak ass sellers still drop their price down to them rather than hold out for an extra ten minutes and have the buyers come up because of fomo on fewer units on offer	Ninja-Yodeler	0

2020-05-12	23:37:12	"To add some more color to this;

Bots can act faster to place order, and can also scale further to multiple markets, so bots have a clear advantage when acting according to any predefined trading method.

However, algorithms that trade on a short term use recent market movements as part of their algorithm (rather than company fundamentals), and humans play a big part of market movements, so bots act quickly on emerging human trends.

So if you trade on instinct you can still be ahead of the bots, but still any profits above the average company trade is a zero sum game in the long term, so humans can only profit the net amount of losses minus the profit bots make. And i imagine a relatively small percentage of human traders would take a big chunk of that human profit."	9aaa73f0	0

If automatic re-investment is very important to you, I would suggest looking at Passive Indexed Mutual Funds. The fees are slightly higher than ETFs (although still much cheaper than most actively managed funds) and some offer automatic re-investment.	Majinn_182	0
2020-05-13	03:59:21	"Fees are charged within the fund, so they would reduce your returns. 

With regards to fees, ETF fee ranges can vary depending on the fund, how specialised it is and if it is active or passively managed. High fees aren't ideal, but it doesn't explicitly mean that the cheapest funds are best. 

There are some really great mid fee options with interesting themes or smart beta options that can be worth the extre few bips."	frad_darsh	0

2020-05-12	19:09:48	"> You think banks aren't running numbers and stats on industries that are getting a lot of JK?

Of course they are. Thats just prudent risk management.  

I'm saying that if I held onto my job during Covid and my wage was supplemented by JK, no information the bank has access to will be able to tell that I received benefit from the JK package - because *I* technically never received a direct benefit from JK. My employer did, the government directly subsidised the cost of my employment.  

The bank will probably adjust ratings on at-risk employment sectors, but as far as individually assessing loan applications - jobkeeper will not be a factor.

I looked at their homepage and can't tell if they are building a quantum computer or exploring for minerals, they seem to be doing both at the same time? Getting a patent isn't that exciting considering what gets approved. Proving it has any worth whatsoever in court is a lot harder.

Quantum computing and biotech research *while* also an explorer?  Heh.

Maybe they actually have something good, but it feels hilariously buzzword. Perhaps one of their tenements struck it big?

2020-05-12	04:22:13	"The chance of a second wave happening wouldn't affect the valuation of these stocks unless a second wave did actually happen. Right now, from the news we have been given, domestic travel is starting to resume - and even if most people won't travel due to fear, some will have to for necessity (i.e. family reasons, business etc.). International travel could open up later on in the year, but that's only a possibility rn.

The reason why WEB and FLT is soaring is because they both got heavily oversold (70-80% drops) during late February and early March. A rising market, although irrational based on our current and near-term economic situation, has enticed new FOMO and existing investors into invest in these particular stocks given how beaten down they are.

But in the long term, both businesses have good capital and are big players in the travel industry. When the virus is over, some will need to travel and many others will be able to despite a recession or depression scenario. WEB also have a B2B hotel beds business which was growing before the virus, so they do have some diversification outside their online travel agency.

Tldr: If you wanna risk it, now's as good a time as any to buy as they are still 50-60% down. If it goes down, buy more. But I could be biased coz I have money in WEB, so always do your own research."	malbro08	0

Their Q3 results come out tomorrow so it could potentially go either way.

In Germany prior to the GFC there were 4 major banks and now there's 2. I think buying banks is lazy investing. They're very highly leveraged, borrowing vast sums of money to lend out again and are maximally exposed to any economic downturn. You'd be better off buying the index and even that's not the best course, IMO.	hidflect1	0

Reading the paper is so much easier to skim and scan online and you can search specifically for news to do with your companies. And their pre, mid, and post open newsletter gives you a pretty ideal amount of info if you don't actively keep an eye on markets through the day. 
But I do find the articles themselves pretty dramatised and over exaggerated a lot. But it's good for reading between the lines. 

I also get a lot of my rural sector news from the weekly times app/paper. Far less common to find things related to the financials of a company etc but you get good info that's not always reported directly to market as it's happening. Plus the articles aren't assuming you're an investor and therefore don't skew the facts one way or the other.

Just make sure if you set up DRP that The dividend on your small parcel of shares will be likely enough to to able to cover the cost of at least one share with each dividend.

Why no (non banking, or airline) blue chips at all?

Banks, shopping centres, airlines are gonna be smashed for at least the rest of the year. Why buy them now?

Also, I wouldn’t suggest talking about buying $500 or $1000 in a single stock. I’d suggest buying $1500-3000 in only very good stocks and a hand full of speculative stocks.

In times of such low interest rates and changes in the world (the internet), Australian banks are not going to be anything like they were 20 years ago.  If you are under 25yo you should be thinking ahead to where things will be in 20 years time, at least. That is why I think the NDQ recommendation is such a good one.  

Try listening to some free podcasts to get a broader understanding of shares and investing.  I can recommend the [Motley Fool Australia](https://omny.fm/shows/triple-m-motley-fool-money/playlists/podcast) and [The Money Cafe](http://www.radio-australia.org/podcasts/the-money-cafe-with-kirby-and-kohler) as a couple of good places to start.  Of course don't believe everything your read, hear or see, but you listening to others viewpoints and discussions helps you gain more understanding and knowledge on what can help you achieve your own goals.

Interest rates, competition (other banks, internet, online, etc), Royal Commission recommendations and the fact that the world is changing fast all point towards the fact that the 4 banks in Australia have a rocky road ahead. It might ""recover"", but the growth prospects are limited.

Sure CBA is not the worst thing in the world to invest in, but there things are not as easy as they were 20 years ago.  Compare the potential of CBA to NDQ and there is clearly one winner.  Even forgetting NDQ, there are many better options for investing for a 20 year timeline than an Australian bank.

2020-05-11	04:40:16	You want the highest possible dividend for any company with strong cash flow, low capital requirements and good organic growth. Targeting x% =/= a good company. Usually IT/finance based companies meet these requirements. Then you get capital growth and growing dividends as organic growth happens, more cash flow which they have no need for = higher dividend payout.	WowVeryJosh	0

2020-05-11	00:58:19	It really depends on your personal situation. I don't know the rate at which you save and your preferences etc. For reference however, you are paying 1% of your brokerage as fees if you invest $1000 with commsec, 0.4% if you invest $5000, 0.2% if you invest $10000, 0.15% if you invest $20,000 etc. As you invest with larger parcels you lose less (percentage wise) in fees. I personally go $5000 at an absolute minimum, but prefer higher amounts. Just look over the fees, do some maths and consider for yourself. You don't want to eat up a significant portion of your returns through brokerage. Best of luck.	Cuzzamuluzza	0

Pre Corona price of around $2.40. Currently trading at $0.88. This is way too cheap IMO.   
Obviously retail hit hard but I think we will be back to relative normality soon (at least with regards to travel within ANZ)  
I would expect an uptick in outdoor activities like hiking etc post corona so can see KMD benefiting massively from this.  
Balance sheet is strong so short term cash flow issues shouldn't be an issue. Risk comes around corona causing structural changes to retail. But even then at the high price point of KMD I think they will be safer than other retailers"	FlimsyDrawing9	0

2020-05-12	01:28:38	Everything at the moment is overvalued. This market is completely irrational. I believe a somewhat positive result from Q3 2020 earnings may have deceived the market into believing the economic impact of the virus was minor. Keep in mind, the months of jan, feb, March did NOT bear the grunt of the economic downturn in which the significant rise in unemployment has caused.  This can be verified by numerous national statistical measures. If you don’t believe the charts and graphs, think about personally how many people you can think of that have suffered a decrease in working hours due to the virus. I believe that when the q4 (Keeping in mind q4 has seen the full tenure of the lockdown depending on what happens from now to June) financial reports come out and show a significant downturn the mass sell off that will be seen may lead to a retrace back to lows.

2020-05-09	09:30:49	PE ratios don’t predict the future, they reflect what has happened in the past and how the market expects the stock to perform in the future.	introvertasaurus	0
2020-05-09	16:25:51	"Ratios are honestly a bit of a pseudo science, though they can be useful it's unlikely to be a very good predictor of value. The most important thing is to compare it to similar companies. If the pe ratio of one company is significantly different to its competitors for no reason then it could be a sign that it's over or undervalued. But it's not a highly regarded practice and is usually only used for an initial screening of stocks.

I would look into a DCF model if you were keen to try and get a value. More complicated and once again not a 100% guarantee or anything. The model basically summaries the future value of cash flows based on assumptions and then brings it back to present value. The biggest part of it is justifying your assumptions, e.g why will revenue grow 10% this year. 

As an example as a sanity check I recently created a quick one for FXL, assumed a 50% negative revenue growth for next year and assumed that the same number will continue onwards. This is very conservative and the model spit out a value of over double the current sp, giving me confidence that it is undervalued.

C19 demanded we stay home, yet I saw more people out and about than I ever have.  Maybe we'll see a similar rubber band effect in retail.

After reading up on Humm, noticed that they offer up to $30,000 for numerous types of purchases such as cars and holidays, all interest free. They’re sort of pushing limits of the current BNPL companies, offering slightly bigger types of loans to people at no interest but will definitely penalise users that aren’t able to make payments timely. They’ve got a good idea, but all a matter of how much exposure they’ll be able to gain in their industry.	JointsBlunts	0

2020-05-07	18:14:09	"G'day pal, I used to work in energy retail but not for either of those two. Dont bother using rates as an indicator of anything. Electricity rates in australia are made up numbers with no basis in reality and get adjusted every now and then anyway. While origin more often than not has cheaper electricity than AGL, doesnt mean they always will.

In terms of renewables, I think that while currently AGL is a larger producer of renewable assets,  Origin is a slightly more forward thinking company. I would liken AGL to Telstra, a big behemoth of a company, currently sitting at #1 and historically always has, however the cracks are starting to show. 

I'd go with Origin if you're comfortable holding for yonks, but then again if your not looking to hold for a while then I wouldn't recommend either."	Jesse_Welshy	0
2020-05-07	19:50:58	"Looking at Morningstar's write up it looks to me that AGL are better value at current prices.

ORG are paying out hundreds of millions over the next 4 years to Octopus for their Kraken customer IT platform and a 20% equity position in Octopus. 

It's a lot of money to spend if it does not work as advertised."	sloppyrock	0
2020-05-07	22:12:55	"Origin just invested $500 million into a Uk retailer which gives them 20% stake in Octopus  energy and their Uk operation. But also Octopus energy has some pretty cool tech they used. Part of the deal would give origin exclusive access to replatform with them.. I think Origin look more exciting. That said they have a fair bit of debt.

AGL are also good value and an old faithful. I think either company is strong. You should do well with either. I personally would lean to Origin because they seem to be investing to really shake the market up and bringing proven tech that could see them challenge the market."	Wetrapordie	0

In the current climate, I don’t see a spike in cases, unless it’s completely unprecedented, shutting down all retail businesses.

There are also useful blogs like Strong Money Australia and Mr Money Mustache, I think another called Passive Investing Australia or something. All these are mainly focused on passive investments but have useful information on a variety of finance topics.

And for podcasts I find The Money Cafe a good listen, they answer listener questions each week and cover a broad range of topics.

If you really are at the ""dump it in stocks"" stage and don't want to wait until you have $5k to put in, then sure, I guess put it in an ETF or CommSec Pocket but while it should go up, you need to be prepared for the possibility it spends the next 2 years halving its value.
2. A nice intro to give you confidence that you don't have any glaring fundamental gaps in your knowledge: Youtube ""William Ackman: Everything You Need to Know About Finance and Investing in Under an Hour"". From there try reading The Intelligent Investor. Also, Investopedia is great, try to focus on the investing pages rather than trading but whatever you find interesting is fine, just click around randomly, use it whenever a term comes up you don't understand fully, etc. After all that you'll be well set to do your own reading and you'll have a comparatively decent understanding of what it is that you don't know."	9fences	0

Jurisdiction is also a big factor, with rios mongolian copper mine having a lot of issues with the gov. 

That being said both these companies make a fair amount of their money in iron ore so watch chinese iron/steel stocks to check the demand for their main product.

Both companies are also cashed up and are making big bucks relative to the industry because of their high iron ore exposure. I am expecting some m&a soon in some distressed companies solgold, first quantum, freeport. This will be good for shareholders in the long run"	illwillspills	0

1) I have no qualms about investing in multiple companies within the same sector if I think they’re quality stocks. I just take caution with making sure that I diversify to minimise portfolio’s exposure to industry factor risk. 

2) I guess I’d prefer the ETF because of diversification benefits 

3) I just invest based on my financial position and how much money I am willing to lose at the moment 

4) I read somewhere that you only need to hold 15-20 stocks to achieve full diversification. I currently only have 8 companies in my portfolio and apparently Warren Buffet only holds 4

2020-05-12	08:08:15	With the collapse of real business, ironically stocks are doing well because for many it's the only game left in town. The Fed backstopping risk means people have been incentivised to buy. It's perfectly possible that many companies will never make the revenues to justify their market cap valuations but they could remain elevated for years anyway so long as people believe in them. Look at Bitcoin. No one actually uses Bitcoin (excluding the 1 or 2 people who will reply here that they do...) but it's valued at $1,000's.	hidflect1	0

So, if you have held for over a year, then the taxable portion is just 50% of the profit.  So, $5,000 is added to your taxable income.  37% x $5000 = $1,850 tax payable.  This is assuming you are in that tax bracket and there may be things such as medicare levy, etc.

Paying tax is not a bad thing - it means you have made a profit."	3rd_in_line	0

2020-05-05	15:33:07	I bought in at $8.78 and sold at $18 because I thought it was about to trend downwards again. Makes me sick seeing it in its 30s so quickly	scottnonews	0
2020-05-05	18:05:22	I bought around $20 and sold today. Initially just bought into it for the hype and never intended to hold in the long term, decided not to be greedy for once and managed to grab a bit of a profit	OiYeahNah	0

As I am still somewhat 'young' my entire strategy is built around long term growth and strategic holds. I'm looking several years down the road. I am sure that I could offload these now and re-invest but that doesn't interest me. It is entirely possible that they could revisit lows in the next plunge, but rampant investment will always prop them back up imo.   
The forthcoming weeks would be one of the best times to sell off for a healthy profit If you have no long term ambitions. I have a feeling that they won't be revisiting these heights again for a long time once the economy tanks again."		0

2020-05-05	03:43:54	"I am currently using R to try and construct a machine learning model to predict earnings surprises.

The motivation for this is based upon this paper here.
Key takeaway -

""A machine learning model with earnings and price variables as inputs performs significantly better at predicting earnings surprises than a random choice benchmark.
Surprises that deviate 15% or more can be predicted with 71% accuracy. Exploiting this predictability allows for the construction of profitable trading opportunities. ""

The biggest issue I have his accessing historical earnings surprises and getting a large enough sample size. I unfortunately don't have access to a bloomberg terminal anymore which makes life a bit more difficult.

The issue for retail investors is that you're competing against  organisations that have vastly superior data sources that run into 6 figure per year subscriptions.

2020-05-04	18:43:28	"I like KMD and currently hold around 8K worth.
Ripcurl is a dying (already dead?) brand and a bit of a shart on an otherwise solid company. 

I read a morgan stanley report that mentions after the capital raising they can essentially stay solvent for 24 months i.e one of strongest balance sheets in retail. 

Assuming that lockdown is lifted soonish I think that the current price is a bargain given winter is just around the corner and people will be eager to travel. 

My only concern is the amount of structural shift away from instore shopping (KMD has like 3% online sales or something pathetic ) and how much damage covid has done to peoples disposable income. People might be delaying their purchase of a $300 puffer.

Both of these are huge unknowns which is why I think the price is around where is it right now"	FlimsyDrawing9	0
2020-05-04	19:34:44	"I think KMD is a strong stock, similar to your reasoning.

Good brand equity, from my experience a lot of repeat purchasers and a solid balance sheet.

I mainly bought on the basis that Australia and New Zealand are handling the coronavirus relatively well, and in the world where international travel is opened up, NZ would highly likely be the first place allowed for Australians to travel to. I assume then that would help KMD a lot.

Eagerly waiting for a business update, if normal stores start to open up (similar to accent), the price should shoot up."	SpaceShip56	0
2020-05-04	19:32:12	"I'm not feeling leisure/travel retail much at all - i think it's less of a sure thing than travel itself eg. airports to me are still more viable than retail. I say this purely from speculation - i just feel people will not be spending the way we assume they will be, and might be travelling for reasons other than excursions where they require equipment. A lot of it is quite pricey to the average consumer, and i feel people will be prioritising other things, stretching out recovery of brands like katmandu for longer than anticipated. That's just my gut feel. I cant wait to be wrong and see the share price rise because ive said this!

Mind you, i think the same thing about people thinking gyms and leisure will be really popular. I know in theory we've been denied these, but sometimes freedom on a limited budget is going to a shopping centre and buying a coffee, not jumping on a plane wearing the latest katmandu jacket. I feel like many people are suspicious of their job security, and that uncertainty doesnt make people want to spend up on travelling to the snow and purchasing a whole heap of gear. I dont know how long the uncertainty will last."	twentyversions	0

The tough gamble is how retail in general will evolve ans grow past this. I'd think with them scaling down to protect themselves and still keeping afloat, it's only positive.

2020-05-05	00:40:22	"If announcements are price sensitive they won't be in the media prior to a company releasing it. Pick an industry and research the hell out of it, or take a punt based on previous announcements (buy before stage 2 of a biotech 3 stage trial for instance).

You can place orders while markets are closed on most platforms, but they won't be filled until the market opens and then only if there's sellers still willing to meet your price"	Shadowbanned_User	0

2020-05-05	04:25:25	"Yes, news jumps at market open.

If you're trading micro/small caps there's room to actually trade, unless you have access to large capital and can make money on 2-8% swings on larger stocks instead.

Theres a youtube channel, I forget the name, but look up ""ASX TIPS"", there's a couple of videos on how to interpret mining announcements and read quarterly financials so you learn what announcement is good and tradeable.

[**The Department is aware of reports that suggest there have been cases with longer incubation periods, such as 24 days. The incubation period of infections often has a skewed distribution, where most patients have an incubation period that clusters around the average, but a few patients have a longer incubation period.

2020-05-04	18:08:55	The general concensus is that the virus is a combination of a virus from bats and spike proteins from a virus from something like a pangolin. Rather than finding this combination in an animal in the wild and studying it, more people are coming around to the idea that the lab basically rubbed bats and pangolins together in a cage long enough to create the recombined virus so that they could study it. Then they messed up and accidentally released it.	vagabond_666	0

2020-05-05	19:54:10	"If you aren’t too skilled at understanding whether a particular stock is good or not buying an ETF can eliminate the chances you end up buying a heap of duds.  I think MQG is a good company with a good future but there could be a scandal or mismanagement or something else that means they crash.  

If you a diversified among many companies a few failing will matter less.  Generally in the long term the market is going to go up.

I’m by no means an expert though - I’m a 20 yr old who only started investing December.  At the moment I’ve got about 50% vas and then the rest split between CSL and MQG but as time goes on I want to add more different companies - I just can’t afford to get diversified quickly because of the brokerage.  If I didn’t buy into an etf it would probably be a good few years before I was diverse as I would like.  It also helps to get exposure to industries I don’t have a good understanding of like mining.  

Hope that makes sense

2020-05-05	19:28:09	As it splits your investment across more companies, i.e. spread the risk. You are unlikely to get as good of a return but your risk is lower.	DunkingTea	0
2020-05-05	22:03:54	sure no problem, I'll link to [Ben felix](https://youtu.be/fvGLnthJDsg) a portfolio manager who will explain it better than me. The basic premise is that what you are trying to achieve is called alpha (to beat the market, through active management) a lot of research has shown that unless you know how to calculate the risk of the portfolio correctly, typically you will never do better than the market as a whole (there are those who think value etc tend to do better but thats quite a deep discussion), so if you can't beat them join them, an indexed fund like ASX VAS for example tracks the s&p 300 and will grow as the Australian market grows, so what you are betting on essentially is that Australia will do well in the long run which is a safe bet imo, as opposed to MQG will it do well in the long run? (imagine a scenario where a they are mismanaged, as well as the risk of disproportionately being exposed to the financial sector). At your age investment should have a horizon of 25 years not a couple, I personally think they will do well in the short term 2-5years but beyond that who can say.	MachinaDoctrina	0

2020-05-06	02:16:21	They only want to invest in short/mid term (1-10yrs). To be honest, in the current climate an etf will take a long time to generate more than well-picked companies imo. Each to their own though, the current climate throws everything out of wack.	DunkingTea	0

Real talk; solid companies in different enough industries. MQG is an absolute solid buy <100.

WES probably won't see much growth but good for divvies and very safe. 

RHC, not a huge fan as I think there is better opportunities in healthcare but nothing much to complain about.

Be careful using P/E as a tool for measuring over/under value. It's a very blunt metric. Like using a fridge to hammer a nail.

It differs hugely by industry, changes depending on the economic environment and sometimes totally not relevant at all i.e Growth companies typically look at P/S and banks you'd be looking at P/BV. Should be used a data point (among many others) to make valuation decisions"	FlimsyDrawing9	0

Pretty good portfolio for the long term (you probably won’t beat the market during crazy bull runs but you won’t lose as much in downturns either I would think).

WES certainly have done better than others in the last few weeks with how quick they've bounced back. Personally I thought they'd tank a bit longer term.

RHC is the interesting one for me their charts have tourettes. Form has been a little more shakey at at a premium. What are your thoughts on where they're heading? Is this a long term one for you?"	bigscuits	0

Government will bail them out.
They will resume operations in some way within the year.
They likely won’t pay a dividend for a year or two.
They will be indebted for some time.
Really, there is little risk of buying it if you’re going for a long hold. The main risk is that we have another pandemic event in the next few years.
We know that there will be hundreds of flights coming from China as soon as possible.
Will continue rorting the public service for city flights to and from Canberra.
They’re actually a pretty well run company despite it being in a very capital intensive industry.

Their share price fell off a cliff and is also largely considered to be about fair value for the shares right now according to institutional investors.

It might be a good buy if you’re a long term holder, the share price (of about half of all time high) is reflective of exactly these things."	HeckingLoveDogs	0

First off - Great post, really good for discussion.

Docusign are playing in a different market - they're focusing on taking PDFs which are already generated and getting them signed digitally, taking payments etc. 

These guys are more a pdf generation and editing tool with a bit of e-sign functionality tacked onto the end so that they offer an 'all in one' solution. 

You wouldn't consider their e-sign functionality if you didn't already use their product for PDF generation.

In my experience in the government info services space we're tending to move away from 'all in one' solutions because of the strategic issues caused by the 'competitive moat' which make it difficult/expensive to change providers.

If they're shifting their model to be subscription based it might be a sign that they've recognized this and are adapting - but it's pretty late in the game and there's a lot of players competing. I'm not sure what they're competitive advantage or market niche is."	Ushi007	0

Trusting instincts and your agenda is like anything in life really isn't it. Sometimes it works, some times it doesn't. Only you would know where your cut off is - we all have different trade plans, agendas, beliefs, gut feelings...

We see a lot of people who read and interpret market changes and graphs and invest in software and brokerage plans to get the most out of it. I the large part though, I just liken it to betting.

2020-05-03	15:48:16	"Sell COL, QAN, STO. 

COL - People are buying it, thinking it's a defensive stock but that's already built into the price. Sales will be less due to the virus, not more and logistical issues will increase their costs. Over the longer term, impoverished Ozzies will eschew the avocado and deli section for Kraft crackers and potatoes. Coles' rents and wages can't be reduced. Maybe they'll save a bit on fuel costs but meh.

QAN - I'm shorting this one for the second time. High fixed costs. Destructed revenue. Any govt. bailout isn't going to benefit the SH's. Even if they do get flying again, it'll be at a fraction of the volume and they'll be competing with a dozen hungry airlines so airfares will be 50% off as they have been. Meanwhile, their landlords, SYD continue to bleed them dry with the rents for their slots. Alan Joyce's ego has seen the company laden up to $4.5B in debt. Good luck paying that off.

STO - There's probably too many players in the Oz oil market and there'll be consolidation in the near future. Again, high cost. Revenues weakening. STO people earn very high salaries but they're needed. Can't fire them like baristas. Lots of costly, capital intensive projects that can't be cancelled. Good luck.

But it all depends what you bought them all for and how urgently/desperately you need cash. 
If you can sell any of them at a profit you're satisfied with (even a small loss) and really need cash in the short term then go ahead I guess. 
In the medium to long term (i.e. a few years) though I believe the other 6 are good holds. 
I wouldn't sell half of each, that seems like unnecessary brokerage."	aqualung_steve	0
2020-05-02	17:15:47	"I think most of your holdings are long term play, so you should have enough liquidity to endure short term losses on some. 

I'm holding QAN atm, but they are not gonna be at their Dec 2019 state until 2023 from what other majors are saying globally. However, keep in mind that effectively, they are a monopoly atm, so no matter what the Feds won't let them fall. Can you imagine letting the Spirit of Australia crash? It's political suicide. No matter what the average Joe says about Virgin, they are culturally and psychologically attached to Qantas.

I've been seeing comments saying QAN is going down to $2 or $1.50, but I want to hold for at least 10 years, so I'll buy if it's that cheap. I wouldn't be surprised if they do decline due to low revenue (domestic travel will be back by Oct this year I think, so it won't be 0). But I'll be more surprised if they go down below 1.5."

Your point is well made though, sales probably won't increase as people have stocked up on some stuff and should also be eating out more, in theory.

Qantas, I am moving on at whatever price i can get tomorrow. Can't see it going up much, if at all, so can't hurt. I think i'll do the same with Santos as you and someone else has pointed out about the oil situation.

It's funny you mention WAF. I purchased a parcel recently but a stop loss triggered on Friday morning and they disappeared off my books. I suspect the stop loss was set a little too high so something i'll need to revisit."	manorto	0
2020-05-02	19:02:47	Thanks Steve. I had a feeling VCX would be one of the ones nominated. A lot of my holdings I’m just up or just down on as they’re all relatively new holdings so not too attached to them as such. My simplistic thoughts with both VCX and VRL were that when we return to some normalcy they’ll be the types of stocks that will see some growth as investors look ahead to the future. Not sure if that’s the right way of looking at it though (I suspect it’s not).	manorto	0
2020-05-02	18:54:59	Thanks for sharing.

2020-05-03	05:57:44	yea your right, the knock on effects of a debt holder like Lehman Bros. snowballed into huge debt defaulting, so far most governments have staved off any major bankruptcies, even virgins administration was kind of predictable (negative cash flows for a long time) it was more the straw who broke the camels back, no one was very shocked, so the knock on was minimal. Most businesses will bleed for a while but the restrictions are already easing so a year or too of hard times (for them) but no ones defaulting.	MachinaDoctrina	0
2020-05-02	15:17:52	the opposite of panic-selling is stubborn-holding. BBOZ and etfs like it are designed to deteriorate over time. it's for short hold plays, long holds makes little sense. Holding for two years waiting for another crisis when the govt has shown flex and muscle to give away money against this one, may qualify as stubborn-holding or attempts to time the market.	mdkb	0

So it basically starts losing value from beta decay within the first 24 hours of holding. Leveraged ETFs aren't meant for long term holds, they're meant to be used for short term trend following.

There are so many differing factors in comparison to the GFC. Even the news cycle is so much more intense now than it was before. Even in 2007 the majority of people still couldn’t really get news unless it was on the TV. Now, it takes seconds for the whole world to find out on the internet. That helps speed up responses and the recovery.
Everything is going to work out.
Right at the start of the virus pandemic, I saw one guy complaining that he has to declare bankruptcy for his business because it had been 10 days since the restrictions.

2020-05-02	10:45:40	"Flights between Sydbourne were already down 30% in November '19. Alan was lucky the virus came along to mask the crater he'd flown the company into trying to build it up as big as his ego by taking on massive debt and expanding it beyond the regional airline it functionally is into some global mega-hauler. Guess he had to justify being the highest paid CEO in Australia somehow. 

QANTAS is a low margin, high fixed-cost operation and it's SP has only stopped from imploding to a dollar because of its name recognition and a suspicion that the government will backstop them if things get dire. But that won't save the shareholders who would get wiped out in any bailout. Also, they're unionised so it's hard for Alan to fire workers.

I made just over $40K shorting (QANKOV) them from about $6.50 and re-entered a small short Thursday for another taste. IMO, it's all risk for you to go long here with very little potential upside. Are you expecting them to go to $4-5? Based on some vague public expectation that they'll re-open in the future? Do you have any solid analysis or just a hunch? Meanwhile their massive fixed costs keep eating away at them every week with almost zero revenue.

I blame the gutless financial media for people still holding them actually. They steadfastly refuse to write about QANTAS' situation with any full analysis of the costs and price expectations because they probably think it would be unpopular to be seen picking on the Flying Kangaroo so they adroitly avoid the topic.

Even when QANTAS does get back to normal flying some way off in the future, they'll be competing with a pack of starved airlines all offering big discounts to get bums on seats again. That's if anyone has the money, holiday leave or desire to fly in a can with 200 other people."	hidflect1	0

You should be receiving the confirmation email a few minutes after the trade has gone through which shows you exactly how much you are being charged.

nabtrade allows you to buy overseas shares easily (eg. USA, Hong Kong, etc) without having to fill out any extra forms.  SelftWealth doesn't allow overseas trades currently.

Thanks for pointing that out u/3rd_in_line! I bought at Market price. I did it again with Afterpay and again the confirmation email showed almost a 3$ higher price than the price displayed on the platform when I bought it even though I received the order confirmation email relatively quick. Luckily Afterpay and Openpay seem to be doing well this week.. Would you suggest to always use Limit orders and buy at specific value or do you often buy at Market price?"	paus20	0

So unable to modify submitted orders, and some minutes delay to have the cash available after they go through.  They rolled back the code that was causing it, and I haven't noticed any issues since.	danbradster2	0

2020-05-01	18:30:40	"0.27% management fee comes out of the pool of funds so like others have said, you don't actually pay that fee directly. But it is taken out whether you invest via Commsec, Self Wealth, Vanguard etc. This fee will always be taken.

The 0.2% fee per anum works out to be $2.00 per $1000 invested, per year.

Between $1000 and 10k invested in Commsec you pay $19.95 per trade (one off fee when you buy or sell).

2020-05-02	21:23:25	"Like others have said brokers such as commsec and selfwealth will charge a one time brokerage fee every time you buy or sell. 

Vanguard account will allow you to buy exclusively vanguard ETFs without a brokerage fee but an annual fee of your daily balance at a rate of 0.20% quarterly.

It will likely come down to the following:

- how much you intend to invest each time ($100/$500/$1000/$10k etc)
- frequency of your investments (weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly etc)
- your time frame (are you investing to later buy a house/kids education/retirement/indefinitely?)

It may be the case that one option is better now and later you may switch to the other. For example:

You’re looking to invest small amounts monthly now $100-500/month, even selfwealth at $9.50 a trade will start adding up. So you may choose vanguard and they’ll charge you a fee quarterly of the annual rate of 0.20% of your holdings may be $2 to $20-30 for a whole year!

This scenario you’ve definitely saved the excess brokerage you’d had paid with selfwealth or commsec. 

But as you build up your portfolio it may be better to transfer your holdings to selfwealth or commsec and buy in larger amounts and less frequently. Or maybe your circumstances change and you need to pause how often you’re investing even, then moving to either broker would save you the annual fee when you’re not actively investing. 

One thing you may want to look into is CHESS sponsorship, selfwealth & commsec are both CHESS sponsored but I recall the vanguard online account is not, as they’re a custodian."	_Shado	0

That is correct. 

“However, if I buy through Vanguard, am I correct in saying that there would be no brokerage fee, but I would have to pay a 0.2% account fee which would be $20, and I would have to pay that $20 each year? Whereas in Commsec I just pay those $10 initially with each transaction?”

Vanguard: you pay 0.20% on the value of your portfolio annually, but you’re charged quarterly. So every quarter you’d be charged (0.20%/4). 

Assuming your portfolio stays at $1,000 (which it won’t due to market fluctuations) the fee would be $2. But when you have $500 it’ll be $1 (this is the annual fee). 

You’d likely be able to transfer these to another broker later too (fees may be involved have to check with vanguard but usually broker to broker is free for most online brokers), so effectively speaking you’d park them at commsec free of charge afterwards. 



Commsec: you’re correct, $10 each trade when the value is $1000 or less and providing you have a cdia settlement account linked. 




CHESS Sponsored means the shares are in your name and you have full rights and control over it. If commsec went bankrupt the shares are still yours. Where as a custodian owns the rights to the shares and effectively if bankruptcy occurred it may be harder to gain back control of your shares. (There’s probably other aspects that are different too that I’m unaware of, transferring shares from a custodian may be harder sometimes, and other times you may not have choice of how you receive dividends but you can usually find these things in the FAQ at respective brokers)


Personally with the lower capital you’re using I’d focus on cost savings to start with. I’m also building a new portfolio with low capital so I’m looking at commsec pocket to take advantage of cheaper rates to get started. 

Please be mindful though that any information I’m providing is general in nature and you should make you’re own decisions based on facts and research of your own :)"	_Shado	0

2020-05-01	16:19:32	With Telstra I feel that it's not that it's a weak company or anything, just that its prospects for future growth seem a bit limited to me. I know there's the potential for 5G, but when I think of Telstra I think of a strong company whose influence is very slowly declining (they were effectively a monopoly not all that long ago).	Acetrainer333	0
2020-05-01	16:47:05	"As someone who worked with Telstra as a partner for many years, having seen how the sausage is made, there's no way I would touch them.

The money that gets wasted with mismanagement, incentives and borderline fraud is ridiculous. As someone else stated, they are hardly undervalued at 36 billion. 

Communications is just getting cheaper and cheaper, they can no longer make the exorbitant profit blindsiding customers like previously."	Johnasdr234	0
2020-05-01	15:58:40	"Telstra would be the last telecom company to go under in Australia because of what you mentioned “lots of other companies run off of their infrastructure”

At least for me:

* It's the biggest, but it's never/rarely used that competitive advantage in any meaningful way (they have pretty standard offerings by Big 4 standards, and worse vs smaller/online banks)
* It's in a market ripe for disruption. ING was a start to it, but look at all those digital banks popping up overseas and starting to enter the market here. Way faster to get approvals, signed up and transacting. Beem is a good app and a good start, but i don't see it's digital platforming evolving fast enough
* All the big banks are in the bad books of regulatory bodies at the moment. I have doubts that all the fines and actions thus far are the end of it.

2020-05-01	13:56:59	"**DYOR**  
**Short Version;**  
Why are you interested in retail? I would not be touching SCG or VCX right now and I have no idea why you would want to.   
If you're looking for cheap retail stocks with lots of runway to jump back look at Katmandu or City Chick. Outside of retail there is many many more stocks that are better valued right now and have more room for growth  


**Long Version;**

1) Insurance wont cover landlords for loss of income   
2) Smaller stores may have bank guarantees to cover defaults which may give short term relief for SCG or VCX, but then they have to fill empty vacancies.   
3) There has been a (slow) cultural shift away from in person retail to online shopping . Covid may have accelerated that shift ever more.

4) When restrictions are lifted, there still a chance that people may not rush out to buy due to behavioural conditioning from social distancing and lack of funds. 

In summary this basically means that yes there will be short term pain  (which the market has   
 arguably priced in ) but the biggest unknown is how  the virus will impact consumer behaviour. That is too much uncertainty for me and I think SCG and VCX are done and dusted."	FlimsyDrawing9	0

2020-04-30	21:37:31	I'd have to read their T&C to answer that specifically (I personally don't own APT) but I would assume they would sell it to debt collectors, much the same as a bank would. They would I assume hedge their position with insurance and make their money with interest, for every one person who doesn't pay 5 would, they woukd have a risk model for that, same as a bank does for credit cards.	MachinaDoctrina	0
2020-04-30	21:39:51	This is my biggest problem I’m having with it too, Im not sure how these companies could be profiting if they don’t make money through the transactions? And they don’t charge interest for a missed payment? How will they reclaim the debt? Z1P is the same it spiked but it’s running at 500% debt to capital and not charging fees and continues to elevate.	THT_Jacko	0
2020-05-01	00:07:28	Max of $400 per person with afterpay though so the actual default risk is quite low since people have the ability to pay $400 off before defaulting. And if they don’t they can return the item to the retailer...pretty safe as far as I can see	yak799	0
2020-05-01	00:41:27	They don't let you rack up that much debt. And the dole is double at the moment. I'd be surprised if they can't get a few hundred bucks out of the kmart bogans who have maxed it out - they don't want to lose their not-a-credit-card because they can't get a real credit card.

2020-05-01	16:59:28	No, from my understanding there is a higher max than that. It depends from person to person and your history with them and what they deem is a safe amount to lend to you. I’ve used it once before and my max is $600 but believe they go up to $1200 for some.	alphaathena	0

2020-05-01	16:09:17	"Origin Energy will spend more than $500 million to take a 20 per cent stake in UK-based retailer Octopus Energy and a licence to its customer platform in a move that it expects to yield up to $150 million a year of savings from 2024. The ""strategic partnership"" announced on Friday will deliver a significant improvement in customer experience, reduce costs and open up future growth opportunities, Origin said on Friday. Origin's 3.8 million retail electricity and gas customer accounts will be transferred to Octopus' Kraken platform over the next 24-30 months. Payment for the deal is in stages, with an initial $134 million up-front, followed by $373 million of instalments and progress payments over the next four years. Origin chief executive Frank Calabria said the new platform would ""make every transaction simpler for our customers"" through automated and customer-oriented processes. Since it started up in 2016, Octopus has grown rapidly in the UK to take about 5 per cent of the market and is growing at 40,000-50,000 customer a month, Origin said. The firm announced a partnership with European retailer E.ON in March to migrate 6 million UK customers to the Kraken platform over the next two years, it added. Some $80 million-$100 million will be spent over four years to implement a customised version of the Kraken platform across Origin's retail business."	Sticker583	0

Kills me that NDQ is still 0.48% compared to VTS is 0.03%  MER.  I would hate to think how much returns I've missed out by avoiding the MER on the core of my portfolio.

VAS tracks Australia’s top 300 companies(= those companies that you listed + more), it also pays dividends every quarter.

2020-04-30	07:30:11	Specifically Vanguard use ComputerShare, you just have to register with them using your HIN and they will update the registry once the contract has gone through (sometimes takes up to 3 days), there you can set up banking details for dividend payment or register for the DRP (Dividend Re-Investment Program) (either partial or full), you can also get tax info etc. from there. There is also some tax implications with DRP's, under some circumstances DRP avoid adding to your income tax (although VAS dividends are partially franked, VGS not as they are international companies).

If that's your plan in the beginning stick with it, why change your strategy now just because the share price dropped, you have to expect good and bad times when it comes to investing"	911Blue	0
2020-04-30	20:16:25	"I think what you need to look at first is things that have nothing to do with the share price.

From your post it's just seems like you want to sell because the price has dropped, but you need to look at the business first and work out if the price decrease is a indication of something bad in the business or just general market conditions.

Why did you initially buy the shares?
How long did you plan to hold them for? 2 years? 5 years? 10 years? 20+ years?
Has their core business changed to something you are no longer interested in? (Aside from the fact there are some short term world problems)

Has the reason you bought the stock changed? And why do they make you want to sell?


It's silly just sell the shares cos their price has dropped now. It's like your are trying to buy high and sell low."	rhubarb56	0
2020-04-30	20:34:10	"Hold. You only lose when you sell. NAB's a blue chip. Over time the price will go up and you'll receive dividends too. 

Unless it's your whole life savings and you need cash etc etc."	ShirleySerious1	0
2020-04-30	21:35:49	Since you’re in for long-term investment, if I were u, I’d  purchase more units while share price are low, which helps to reduce the “purchase price $24” (via dollar-cost averaging). Whereas if you sell now, it means you’ll be making real losses +more brokerage fees, and it’s not guaranteed that you’ll get it back with other companies. You’ll also miss out on NABs up-coming dividends $0.30 (ex div date- tomorrow), which still isn’t so bad if you compare it to other blue-chip companies that are planning to suspend it.	yj520	0
2020-04-30	20:51:59	"I initially bought to hold long term. I guess the main reason I'm looking at selling is due to pessimism around the banks' recovery time. I have limited capital to invest, and I can't help but wonder if the dollars I have in NAB right now might multiply quicker in other stocks. If I had plenty of money to invest, for example, I might just buy more NAB in the SPP to bring the average purchase price down, but it's not an option for me at this time. 

&#x200B;

What about option C? NAB's institutional placement sold shares at $14.15. I wonder if the SPP price won't be much different from that, and if it isn't, then what's stopping me from selling at \~$17, repurchasing same qty at \~$14 and keeping the difference?

Thanks for your reply."	Windhurtler	0

2020-05-01	14:54:16	"The issue is if it is oversubscribed. Their last SPP in 2009 everyone's requests got scaled back 70%. I had the same idea until I looked into it a bit more.

From one article I read last night:
The issue for retail shareholders is that the SPP is currently only $500m in size. If 25% of NAB shareholders elect to take part, this means an average allocation of just over $3,500 each. If 50% of shareholders take part, an average allocation of just $1,754.

2020-04-29	21:52:21	"Along with everyone else, Macquarie for sure. Even within the retail space, they have aggressively targeted the 'super prime' borrower with low loan-to-value ratios over the past few years, so would have a very clean loan book. Not to mention they are significantly diversified, being primarily an investment bank who is, and will continue to, clean up on equity raising and the M&A activity likely to occur now. 

If I had to pick any of the Big Four (by elimination) - Westpac and NAB have too much in business banking. Westpac is already trading so low I wouldn't be surprised if it represents some value, but would be risky. NAB's provision for home loans had a 92.5% weighting towards a 'V' shaped recovery, which is surely optimistic (I reckon more pain to come). 

ANZ doesn't have the business exposure but also isn't as successful; they're priced more competitively than the other majors on Loans and Deposits which suggests to me a desperate attempt to win market share at the expense of profit. 

The only one I'd feel safe with at the moment is CBA - their strategy is a big tick (they're killing it in the broker space vs the other majors), and have invested in youth accounts for long enough to start seeing a return. Once the dust settles I can't see why their dividend won't return to where it was, they might even be able to capture more market share as others struggle more."	holman8a	0
2020-04-29	19:01:13	I think Bank of Queensland will see some great growth over the next 3 to 5 years. Price is very low at the moment. Was approx. $9 prior to COVID-19 and now sitting at approx. $5. Their digital services for customers is really sub-par at the moment, however, I’ve heard they’re currently in process of a digital services upgrade that could see a lot more customers joining. Also, they have often provided very competitive interest rates on Term deposits and savings accounts. They do have ownership of Virgin Money but I think that’s completely separate to the airline.

An app is apparently on the way but will be released through their virgin money arm before it will be rolled out with BOQ. A problem with BOQ is that they acquired many different banks, building societies etc so their systems are all different for various functions and not unified, hence the problem with functionality on their digital service.

It's all about what information people have on hand about potential future earnings weighted with the risk factors of the company	MachinaDoctrina	0
2020-04-29	18:38:05	"In all honesty, no one knows for certain if the market will crash again or recover. If someone tells you that it will, consider that as nothing more than their opinion and don’t think of it as a hard fact. 

If you’re interested in investing, figure out how you expect the stock, you want to invest in, to behave. 
Then decide when and where you want to enter, based off of how you think it’s going to perform. 
And set a Stop Loss order at the very most you’re willing to lose in case it does crash or drop significantly.
If the market doesn’t suffer from some sort of down turn, and the shares you invested in perform well, you can always lock in your profits by raising your Stop Loss over your initial purchase price. Alternatively, you can look into whether or not you broker offers Trailing orders, which would do this ‘Lock in’ process for you automatically. 

Ultimately, the market could crash again so managing your risk and losses is important but it has an equal chance to recover so waiting for something that may never come could just lose you potential profits. Either way be safe, cautious and think your investments through!"	TheAustralianTrader	0

However I do not believe this is the case for gold as there is somewhat of an inverse relationship between the stock market and gold prices (as one goes up, GENERALLY the other goes down (I reiterate the emphasis on generally). 

Gold is a great hedge for inflation however people panic and when they do they go to gold as a safe haven, and if you have been to supermarkets recently you know people have panicked.

20% of your portfolio is not an insignificant amount. you're 25 and will financially recover from this shock and then some. by all means invest in gold however i would wait 1-2 years and hope panic subsides.

Gold is currently trading at peak price. This is common in times of high market volatility because gold is a safe asset. If you buy in now you will not be buying at a discount. Better off to drop that money into an ETF or active stocks whose prices are currently depressed. You stand to earn more over the short to mid term. Best of luck."		0

Stick to vdhg unless you want to apply particular weights to specific companies (e.g you think APT will experience high growth). That said you can also buy both and weight to your preference."	ToiletHumorPoet	0
2020-04-29	13:02:47	"Yes you can have too much diversification. It depends what you are trying to achieve. It is more difficult to beat the market if you essentially hold so many stocks you are replicating the market. You will have winners and losers, but if you are spread too thinly across too many, your winners won't have enough weighting to make a difference to your whole portfolio.

It also makes it more difficult to stay on top of.

That said, around 15-20 stocks is what i would aim for with $100k. Buffet i think prefers to have <15. 

Assuming you are using Selfwealth, $2k per trade works out to be \~0.50% brokerage which is OK. Anything >1% and you are probably trading too small a parcel."	lifeDNP	0

The cons of decreased risk is that your portfolio returns are gonna be more subdued (I.e. Less chance of monster outperformance or underperformance - if you're mathematically minded - assume returns are a bell curve, by decreasing risk, you're reducing the standard deviation)"	akkatracker	0

2020-04-28	01:47:50	"1) I keep 90% of my savings in stocks. If you have a safe job, living situation and a cash buffer, at your age there is no reason not to maximise your long term return by investing in high risk, high reward assets like stock.

2)  Savings to me means net liquid assets - stocks count, imo, though they should be considered somewhat separate in the sense that they can't always be touched without consequences. For example, converting stocks to cash right now if you'd bought them 6 months ago would be a terrible idea, as you lost a bunch of money and crystallised the loss. Regardless, what you've mentioned is an arbitrary benchmark... Ignore it and come up with your own numbers that you'd be happy with.

3) The benefit of diversification comes in that it reduces your risk from occasional, bad events or companies, while still getting as good a return as concentrating all your assets in a single company. Occasionally concentrating your money on a single company can do very well if that company does very well, but it also exposes you to massive risk if something goes wrong.

4) Yes. 

5) IMO, no. Not at your age, and not with yields this low. Many would disagree with me, so I wouldn't necessarily take my opinion as representative."	ClearlyAThrowawai	0
2020-04-28	01:57:53	"1. This depends entirely on when you buy in. Due to your unique situation you can probably afford to put in significantly more than 20% and shoulder the costs of a slow recovery.
2. I couldn't tell you but I imagine that it would depend entirely on each individuals personal circumstances. 
3. Diversifying your portfolio is ALWAYS a good idea. Always look at the health and performance of the company first. When it comes to sectors, there is no set number that you should aim to have a presence in, but many would be obviously be preferential over few. 
4. Yes. Never invest more than you are willing to lose. Invest all dividends back into the market or other investments (property, crypto etc).
5. ETFs may be more preferable in your case

&#x200B;

1. At our age, we can afford to take risk and with a long time horizon it will pay off. Put all of your savings except emergency fund and near term goals (holidays etc) in risky assets.
2. Who cares. You live at home and have a safeish job, have an emergency fund of 1 month of spending (your 'very little' personal expenses). Anything more is just wasting your capital.
3. Rule of thumb is around 10 lowly correlated risky assets (although corellations spike in times like corona). Generally if you throw 10 darts at the top 300 companies on the ASX you'll be fine, or use ETF's.
4. Buy whenever you save up $1000 above your emergency fund and short term goals.

An 8% return ends with 2M. Sure, there's volatility along the way (see: Coronavirus) but you get compensated by higher returns. This is being generous, too, as there is nowhere paying a ""safe"" 4% right now."	ClearlyAThrowawai	0

When you pick individual stocks you need to look at the micro and macro, otherwise you are at an disadvantage.

Where as crypto its gets is value, due to its limited supply and some utility. But this utility will not change significantly unless all the world governments try ban it ( not tiny countries like australia ). Once you understand the technology and why people value ( eg understanding MMT ) there is not much you need to monitor. You can just browse reddit and that's not that hard.  It valuation is mostly based on speculation at the moment.

Where as for my stock portfolio i have to a do a tone of research and I need to pay to get information that's easy to digest that i can skim often eg simply wall st. If i had to manually read financial reports ( come up with earnings forecast ect )  and collate this research by myself i would not have time to invest in stocks.

Crypto comes with its own risks though, you need to securely store them and not lose them, this for most people is probably the biggest risk. If you aren't technically savvy this might be a significant risk to you."	Spartan3123	0

2020-04-28	01:37:57	"Having listened to some of the investor presentation, i'm disappointed in the reasoning. If the board wasn't happy with a 10.5% CET ratio in good times, with the understanding it gets reduced during the bad, they should have been increasing the buffer before something happened, or stopped giving away cash in dividends. If you want to stay above 10.5% in bad times as well, then it seems pretty stupid to wait until they occur and only then ensure you have a sufficient capital ratio.

To raise 3.5B at depressed share prices, while paying out a 1B dividend doesn't speak to me as a company that cares about the long term return to shareholders. I understand the reasoning in ""getting ahead"" of worse share prices and perhaps a worse deal in the capital raising (and avoiding a catastrophic wipeout in the depths of a recession), but to still distribute money is just irresponsible, imo.

That being said, their actual earnings only dropped 8%. This will obviously get worse next half, since we spent most of this half in normal conditions, but the large drop in net profit is mostly due to provisioning for a worsening situation."	ClearlyAThrowawai	0

But in the coming months it is almost inevitable that NAB will post big losses due to deferred loan payments and bankruptcy from loan holders. 

It’s really just a question of whether it’s been proved in or not. And I personally was happy to by NAB at a 40ish percent discount from its recent peak, as I believe they, like the other big four banks, will pull though and in a few years be succeeding. 

I am however am not a fan of the fact NAB is paying dividends while at the same time diluting their shares, but I assume this is because some retail investors live off of these dividends.

Either way, I personally was happy to buy NAB, partially due to the company and their position, and partially due to the expectation that if they royally fuck up the government will be there to bail them out, as uncapitalistic (if that’s a word) as it might be."	JustKaiOK	0

2020-04-27	18:04:57	Decent company. They're being quite financially conservative at the moment, which is a necessity. 51% drop in cash net profits doesn't surprise me. I don't own stock but I will probably scoop some up after the trading halt at a discount for a very LONG term hold.		0
2020-05-02	23:30:00	I think buy.. quality company for the long term. They have a lot of cash (4 billion) to deploy for acqusitions. My only wish is that they don't fuck up with future acquisitions. Yet, reaping the benefits from the failed masters endeavour by woolies they should be more discipline and patient with acquisitions......? Nonetheless, the current CEO seems to be one of the best to be leading the company. Other thoughts?	joncn101	0

2020-04-27	03:46:39	confusion about debt/equity ratio	sausagesizzle123	1
2020-04-27	04:06:20	"When analysing companies, always think in relative terms. E.g. 15.1 may seem high, but what are the D/E ratios of ANZ's competitors, are they lower or higher?

Think about how banks run their business. They take on high amounts of short term debt (deposits) and transform those into long term loans (assets). It doesn't surprise me that the D/E ratio is high.

Edit: also OP have a look at the following link to see what debt they include in the formula. They don't include all liabilities which I personally believe is preferable:

If it got to below maybe 8c and NTA stayed above say 70c, I might consider it as a gamble, but otherwise I’d suggest you be extremely wary.	fistingdonkeys	0
2020-04-27	01:54:09	I see. What I'm actually looking at is a bond they've issued with an attractive coupon rate. So I'm not worried about the price tanking with no recovery in sight. I'm more worried that the impending housing market crash will bankrupt them to the point that a bond won't get paid out. But I just don't know enough about how exchange rates and asset values actually affect the company in terms of that. I'm just in a speculation pickle, if it doesn't go broke over the next year I stand to make an acceptable gain regardless of stock price and that's drawing me in, even though I know I don't know enough about the inner workings of reits to really tell if bankruptcy is that close.

Will likely rocket on open on the ASX Monday to catch up to Friday’s US session. May then pull back, so you could have a lower entry later in the day. Maybe.

Looking further ahead, after the weekend’s news, MESO *could* pump again when the NASDAQ opens on Monday. Followed by MSB playing catch up on the ASX Tuesday. Equally, after such a large rise, it could plateau or also correct down. If so, wouldn’t think by too much. COVID-19 is shit hot right now.

Mesoblast ain’t no one trick pony either, read outs are due mid year for advanced chronic heart failure and chronic low back pain. And, Remestemcel-L, the stem cell treatment being administered for COVID-19 induced ARDS, is currently under FDA priority review for pediatric aGVHD. A lot of hopefully positive news to come.

But in order to be eligible you need to own the shares before the record date. I would seriously read articles about corporate actions before taking up offers. Some companies will do increments of $1000 , $2500 etc etc.

I've seen a local entrepreneur bulk import gym gear to sell. Pretty sure he made bank as currently any junk gym gear listed on gumtree or facebook market place will sell.

The idea that the market is at a similar level to where it was a year ago given everything has been practically shut down for a significant period of time, is mental to me. Entire supply chains have been hurt or closed for an indefinite period of time etc. 

I cannot fathom how many small businesses will be able to survive this. So many people let alone businesses seem to operate on the edge constantly.

1) the HIV testing market is quite mature, with every med testing company having their own kits, with long term contracts in place. It will be hard for a start up to dethrone them at least in the western world

2) Presumably HIV test is a low volume test...? Anyhow I can’t see enough kits to be ordered for large scale expansion in the future at off the backs of HIV testing alone, which brings me to my third point.

3) getting other tests approved by the FDA or TGA is a lengthy and costly process, I don’t know if the company will have enough the funding to expand their product range in the short term.

No, its a good indicator. Companies as new as Atomo still holds a great amount of risk, you can't say for sure if its a robust pick just on IPOs lol. Sorry but the ""experts"" who calculate IPOs are not from the future.

\>Oh sorry, you only wanted to know if Myer will recover. Sounds like you've already invested. Ouch.

Thats why I like asking on forums to get different perspectives along with previous research. Concluded there is too much risk going with Myer atm, removed that from my portfolio ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. Imagine critizing someone for using a forum the way it was intended to.

Thats a good point. I looked at their Annual 2019 financial report and you can see they are somewhat slipping from the competition. However they still return a big enough net profit that they can still operate all their stores (and have reduced operating costs 3%).

2020-04-23	16:27:59	Nice one.  Do you think it's better to invest in the gold miners, or in a gold etf like PMGOLD or GOLD?   I'm still on the fence re gold - I recall Buffett's quote that he prefers companies who can grow their business to a commodity.  But also feel gold could become more and more important over the next decade.  MNRS could be a good option.	ShirleySerious1	0
2020-04-23	20:48:25	"Buffet's 100% right on this one. Companies that can increase business by value-adding will outperform miners by orders of magnitude over a longer period because they can grow exponentially. Having said that, my WAF goldie is up 14.5% today. But any casual stroll around the shopping mall will tell you trade is off by 60% at least and so a company digging up gold bars that sell in USD might be the play. I didn't actually buy any MNRS because I'm loaded in enough goldies already but a mix might be good. If you buy PMGOLD you need to buy a fair bit otherwise the fee chews up a fair bit. It's like buying bullion. You get charged. There's a Reddit covering it somewhere. But I reckon it;s still better than buying WOW or CBA atm. So:  
MNRS  
PMGOLD

2020-04-22	04:22:48	"I like to have enough shares in a company that each time they pay a dividend, I have enough to buy an additional share if I am participating in the DRP.

You can work this out by looking at historical dividends and then using this to calculate how many shares you need to buy the anticipated share price at the next distribution. You should add some additional shares as buffer (especially as the next lot of dividends will be reduced heavily)

For an ETF like IVV, which has a share price of ~$450 and pays a dividend of ~$6 (over 4 quarterly payments), you would need around $35k invested to buy a new share each year. For a share like this, I just have the dividend paid into my brokerage account so it's used to purchase the next parcel or another share."	Azza0880	0
2020-04-22	04:56:06	"When I do DRP I like to be able to get one share per dividend payment. It seems about 60 shares in a company will do this. This obviously means you would need a lot more money if the share price is high. But yeah about 60 shares seems to do it for me.

If the share price is high, I tend not to do DRP because its just not very efficient."	cryingcactus42	0

2020-04-22	04:08:31	"Yeah corporate mining finance guy here, pretty much massive oversupply for a commodity that isn’t that valuable. Lithium batteries are only ~1% lithium, but ~80% nickel. That’s the commodity you want to get into, and copper too! All these motors in electric cars need a few kilos of copper windings each.

In general base and precious metals are always the lowest risk to mine and have the most stable demand. They also don’t suffer from substitution, e.g; there’s many alternatives to lithium batteries if lithium gets too $$ or hard to obtain, but there’s no substitute for aluminium/iron/gold etc."	24JJ42	0

2020-04-23	04:34:44	I second this. Nickel is the play. Also, spodumene (the processed ore for lithium) has a shelf life of about 8 months and there's no LME pricing so producers have to arrange private off-takes with (mostly) Chinese buyers who have shafted a number of miners.	hidflect1	0

Spodumene is the raw in situ ore by the way, lithium carbonate is what you get from processing spodumene, which is what you then sell. Funnily enough having a short shelf life is beneficial for Australia as our shipping routes are much closer to China than that of our rivals in South America. Same goes for iron ore from Vale in Brazil. Even though their ore is excellent quality, it’s that much further away and FMG’s utter shit is right on their doorstep."	24JJ42	0

I found some articles saying it was about fear of oversupply, but if that's the case won't the same thing happen again? Could be a good short term buy sell i guess. 

I would assume Covid-19 is gonna crash demand for all cars (especially general passenger vehicles) so Lithium demand will drop?"		0

idk. this looks like share dilution. if anyone can shed some light on this. Some is listed as employee share acquisition plan, most list as for private clients.  


2.8M @ $16.56 = $46M  


2.84B shares issued tho. so not a major effect.  but still.

2020-04-22	13:08:55	With 2 dollar trades up to 1k, its better value to invest as close to the 1k mark as you can. If you could afford to invest 150 per fortnight, perhaps wait until you hit 300 and then invest..HOWEVER a great habit to get into is regular amounts of money being saved or invested. It's 2 dollars per trade, if you invest as little as 100 per fortnight your trading costs over a year will be 52 to have 2600 invested. Some people on this sub will get really worked up about that 52 dollars because its a waste of money etc. But fk that - you are starting out, you probably cannot afford to wait and save up thousands to invest in a lump sum and you are learning... Consider that 52 in brokerage fees as an education cost!	arctic_win	0
2020-04-22	14:17:28	I would say no less than $400. I personally go for 1000-1500. Regular investments are a good idea. Unit price doesn't really matter only that higher numbers mean you can have volume issues at lower amounts.	nutcrackr	0

2020-04-22	22:21:57	"Honestly i think you have to ask yourself if you would invest in the pocket ETFs if they weren't in pocket.

Personally i wouldn't split it 3 ways because then the trading cost of 6 bucks would be bug me.

Its completely up to you if you want to pick 2, 3 or 4 ETFS and split your cash or alternate each month.

The best thing about personal investment is: its personal! You have the responsibility of managing your own money and someone may post an excellent argument explaining why you should save for 6 months and dump the cash in etc. Or why you should put $100 into each of the 7 pocket etfs each month but its your money so assess the comments and jump into what you're comfortable with."	arctic_win	0

2020-04-21	14:12:39	"The 880 million was an institutional placement. Which I believe has taken place. The SPP is a pittance compared to that at 50 million.

It's further dilution. 

I don't follow them so cant say how they will trade, but **if** the placement shares are being already being traded the majority of dilution and share price damage has taken place. 

An extra 50 million dollars worth is not a lot for a big company and wont put much that much  downward pressure on the overall share price. 

The daily swings of market sentiment will push it around more I think."	sloppyrock	0

2020-04-21	02:27:13	"Doesn't really matter.

Key things to look for are cost and CHESS Sponsorship (if you're holding longer term) and platform. Two most common ones are below (CMC, BellDirect, etc are all fine too) 

Commsec is probably the best platform and trades are on average about $20. Huge pro is they let you settle in t+2 days, so you don't need to have the account funded necessarily.

Selfwealth is the cheapest out there in the CHESS Sponsored realm at $9.50 a trade, but not as good platform as Commsec and missing features like t+2 settlement etc."	akkatracker	0

2020-04-22	00:31:47	"Yes because there's actually an area of deadweight loss in the middle as well.

&#x200B;

For example, if Centrelink offers $700 per week (in theory, I don't know the actual numbers) and you get offered work at $800 per week, you're very unlikely to accept given the marginal benefit is only $100 per week when you could just sell some stuff on gumtree, etc or reduce expenses to live on the $700.

This means the actual effect is to put out of work anyone under a particular threshold, with the threshold being higher than the weekly benefit from Centrelink because why work 40 hours for minimal benefit?.

There's a better way to implement benefits which wouldn't have this negative effect, however, the government will never use it."		0

2020-04-19	18:09:00	"Waf is a good one if it successfully starts production. EV of $550m, AISC of <$500, first year of production is 300,000oz will make a fair chunk of its ev in cfs in its first year. Production is unhedged which is important if you are trying to play a rising gold price. Gor is also unhedged but looks relatively expensive. Note unhedged upside also means unhedged downside

Rrl and sar look the value picks in the big end of town, net cash, low aisc, decent growth and in Australia. These companies were sold off with the market and their market cap doesn’t reflect the aud price of gold. 

CDV has a market cap of $150m and the NPV of project of US$750m at gold of $1550oz. 5m oz in the ground thought is a lot when you consider the market cap. This co has low money however and will have to make a deal. An informal offer has been made 20% above current prices but will need more to be accepted.

If you think gold will will rise from here buy a company with high aisc because you are more leveraged to a rising price. If you just want gold in your portfolio to be safe, buy one with lots of resource, low AISC, hedged and a safe jurisdiction."	kimjonggun	0

2020-04-19	17:15:56	"Still currently doing more research on the space and whether it’s better to own gold vs gold mining companies. Gold doesn’t seem to be a good hedge in times of a crises - but going forward with all this money printing inflation and 0% interest I think it may be wise to get some exposure 

Owning direct gold seems to have to advantage of not having operating risks faced by miners, but operational leverage could lend itself to higher upside for mining shares.

What I don’t like about gold miners is that they trade at expensive multiples which seems to demand a premium

Provided if Saracen didn't take on any I would of loaded up with this stock.

2020-04-20	01:03:41	Ach.. I've been following them for nearly a year so it's all built up in my head but basically, they have a very low AISC, they've beaten forecasts to get to production, their gold is unhedged (so get the current high price) and they're on schedule to pay off their debt in about a year. The only reason their price is low is because of the concern over sovereign risk. Mgmt. haven't failed to deliver on a single promise.

From an economic standpoint the business makes sense, I just don’t like the work they do as someone who likes to see quality. They do it fast, cheap and large quantities of work for insurance companies. As a stock I’d say they’re reasonably valued, at the $0.15 they were at previously was grossly undervalued and I genuinely considered buying. At $1-$1.40 they were at a while ago was pricing in a lot of growth. The only way to grow is through acquisition as the industry itself isn’t fast growth.	vBocaj	0

He was  most pessimistic about tourism/travel and restaurants (because if restrictions are lifted in restaurants there may still be density restrictions which continue to make their businesses non-viable - i.e., restaurants make the majority of their money on Saturday with a packed house, if they are allowed to open but are restricted to ""X persons per square metre"" then the restaurant still fail)."	dzernumbrd	0

The capital raising has given them breathing space til 2021, and that money was raised easily, reflecting at least some confidence from institutional investors. They have low overheads, which will be the primary reason for their survival. In saying that, it's definitely a LONG term play now, and if I wasn't holding, I definitely wouldn't be buying.	scarecrows5	0

Seeing that this might take a bit longer, I am limiting my position to a speculative buy (i.e. I won't be buying any more shares until Webjet's business is back to normal) and have rejected the retail offer. Although I believe Webjet is well suited financially to ride this out, I don't want to be overexposed to any potential downside that might be coming (e.g. possibly no significant international travel until a vaccine arrives in 12-18 months) - that being said I won't be selling right now."	malbro08	0

If Flight Centre are shutting down stores they're losing their competitive advantage so probably put WEB in a better spot.

Sure international will take a while to recover, but that should have been priced into Qantas too, and Qantas is sitting at a 50% discount (compared to WEB at \~75%). Sure it doesn't have protection against going under like Qantas do, but I think a lot of people are forgetting that you want your shares to make money, not just survive. Even after losing half it's share price the Qantas dividend as an established company is pretty average."	holman8a	0

A lot of numpties don't understand what we find obvious.  People are hearing of restrictions being lifted and thinking *everything* goes back to normal in a month or two (including travel/tourism/restaurants/etc).  They don't realise that certain areas may remain shut until a vaccine is created. 

To be fair to him, his audience was 20000 people or so and he has 5-10 minutes to speak so he had to keep it dumbed down for the lowest common denominator to a certain extent. 

The other information I found interesting was how long he thinks the housing market would remain depressed.  He thinks even after travel restrictions are fully lifted that immigration will be culled by government to deal with unemployment and that will depress our housing market due to net +ve immigration being the driver of high demand and high prices.  So housing market long term fucked if he's right about immigration."	dzernumbrd	0

2020-04-19	07:01:12	Yeh that might be the case - I honestly don’t know, have just seen some comments on threads about flight centre either not giving credit back or giving credit back for completely different airlines. Webjet struggled with it initially I think with everyone cancelling flights etc but then took the initiative and actually cancelled people’s flights for them on some airlines (you could still go to airport and check in via customer service desk) and thus automatically processed people. This happened to me for a Virgin flight over Easter which made my life easier. Very narrow observation and I could be way off, the issue is very rarely black and white. Cheers for reply regardless.

2020-04-20	04:23:39	"A lot of numpties also have no healthcare experience and don’t realise that the majority of respiratory viruses don’t have vaccines, and the vast majority of disease don’t have vaccines. So holding out for a vaccine is a completely null point. Containing spread and treating serious symptoms is the priority. Usually when patients show signs of lower (and upper tbf) resp disease they don’t even get tested because it is nearly always an unknown virus causing it. If infection survelliance is performed then it’s usual that the screening will come back as negative - because we don’t know what caused it.

People are buying Webjet because they’re massively undervalued. Their P/E is great at around 8 (although higher than others in the industry), PEG is completely reasonable at 1 (arguably very good at 1), very low debt, fantastic dividend rate, experienced execs. Corporate travel is an industry that will expand more in the future as we move closer towards a ‘global market’. Intrinsic value is around 200-400% under depending on calculation. Can you show us another company that is so hugely undervalued?

Could you provide your DD on why Webjet is such a bad choice at this price (because apparently some of us have miscalculated on why this is blatantly obvious)?

For the investor who likes to reserve a portion of their stock for mote highly volatile/riskier companies with high growth potential, Webjet is certainly a potential gem on the ASX.

You’re right about immigration, though. It will be harder for non-Australians to gain visas in an attempt to give residents first pick of jobs. No idea if that will work but imo it sounds like it will have an overall negative affect on recovery. Giving short-term (non-permanent) visa makes more sense to get the economy back up and running. The current sponsorship requirements are that companies need to prove that they have already tried and fail to hire a resident to do the work."	AcidUrine	0

Right now, the travel industry is relatively diverse, with your big players like Webjet and Flight Centre.

Webjet also is the leader in online travel bookings in Australia (along with a growing B2B business) and with less physical capital, I'd say they last out longer than Flight Centre."	malbro08	0

It was more just a general commentary about buying distressed companies in acutely distressed industries is not always a great idea.

Out of curiosity can I ask what numbers are you using for earnings and earnings growth when calculating the P/E and PEG ratio?  They aren't going to be making much earnings this year (maybe next also) and they'll have negative growth.  I guess you must be looking at a 3-5 year time frame if you're using 2019 earnings/growth estimates?

As for visas the company I work for gets around the ""prove you tried to hire a local before you hire offshore"" by sub-contracting to a company in India and then they don't have to prove anything.  We hire the company to provide a 'service' and they provide us Indians that do that service.  If they come onshore their visa is done via the Indian company (who probably do some dodgy shenanigans).

2020-04-18	20:25:17	"If you want to get filled on the opening auction, ideally you want to place an order closer towards the opening time, as placing the order the night before or too early before open you run the chance of missing your entry should it be opening higher than your limit order

&#x200B;

Opening Times

Group 1  10:00:00 am +/- 15 secs 0-9 and A-B, e.g. ANZ, BHP

Group 2  10:02:15 am +/- 15 secs C-F, e.g. CPU, FXJ

Group 3  10:04:30 am +/- 15 secs G-M, e.g. GPT

Group 4  10:06:45 am +/- 15 secs N-R, e.g. QAN

Group 5  10:09:00 am +/- 15 secs S-Z, e.g. TLS

Just check the 'indicative' price on the ticker in the commsec app and run your order a tick or two above it.

&#x200B;

Tips

\-Hotter stocks intraday tend to ram up right up into the open

\-Larger cap stocks you'll probably need to hit in with a higher limit and not a few ticks due to the spread which can move around quite a bit before it opens

\-Also if you are buying a large size. Always check the offer depth (sell side) that there is enough liquidity on the book that you aren't going to ram the price up too far yourself. This can happen with low liquidity stocks"	lookcee1	0

2020-04-18	23:49:56	"Just realised you’re not trying to beat the auction, you simply want to buy shares outside of your busy work schedule.

This is easily done with a ‘good for day’ or ‘good till expiry’ (28 days I believe) buy order.

Say for example I want to buy 500 x ABC shares at a maximum value of $10 per share and as of Friday 4pm their closing price was $10.05.

I can place a buy order over the weekend at 10pm on Sunday night, for 500 shares with a limit price of $10.00 with an order of ‘good till expiry’.

Now let’s assume on Thursday at 3pm, the share price drops back down to $10.00, at which point your order is executed. 

The limit price will always attempt to buy/sell at your set price or better i.e: 
1. A limit price buy order will execute at limit or lower
2. A limit price sell order will execute at limit or higher

If your limit price is not met within your defined expiry period, the order will be terminated and will not be executed."	IncurableThinker	0
2020-04-19	03:55:44	Silly questions are a smart way to accelerate your learning, never be embarrassed. When the share price is on an incline, you're very unlikely to see the close price again next day. So yes, definitely better to purchase near a daily low as early as possible in a run, especially if you're confident why there is a run on that stock right now. If it's tied to an announcement or reporting date, you'll want to structure your exit or profit-taking around that date or ask yourself if you're too late to the party. And if you're not confident why, maybe you want to divide the risk by purchasing at a low on different days while watching the price — or distribute your intended investment between a number of rising stocks?	linlithgowavenue	0

I think my biggest problem to date has been FOMO taking over, so have found myself buying closer to the high than the low, and when the price does reach a certain level, i'm too quick to sell as I'm just happy taking any type of profit (after kicking myself for buying so high). I think I've been too keen to get involved so waiting for the low as you suggested definitely has merit.

I'm still very raw so reviewing my trades and reading and learning as much as i can. It's a whole new world and A LOT to learn.  I've just read a comment that read ""The more I learn the less confident I am"" and i can honestly say, it's certainly feeling that way!"	manorto	0
2020-04-19	04:56:59	Haha, yep. The FOMO is real. Losing money is a great teacher, you'll soon be very disciplined and clinical. Learn as best you can to be less afraid/embarrassed about copping a loss as the price of education — all my reading only began making real sense on the ground, when emotions kick in and you're drowning in doubt. Then you see what you really do and don't understand or what information you needed in front of you at the time. Treat each trade as an exercise, actively asking in what ways were you underprepared then looking for a specific resource to cover that gap — example, earnings calendar/stock futures quote/market futures. You'll soon also get a feel for what a reasonable price is and where a stock might go that day/week, but also quickly let go when something moves too fast and you miss out. After that's happened a dozen or so times you realise there are dozens of opportunities around at any one time. They just need research, timing and confidence.

Why do you think TWE would be trying to branch Penfolds off if it is, as your refer to it as, the family silver? One big move somewhat recently being Coles being spun off from Wesfarmers, but I understand this with Aldi consuming more market share and the (eventually unsuccessful) entry of Kaufland - the supermarket game in 15 years is going to look vastly different to what it does now, and probably to the detriment of Coles. 

Making Penfolds its own entity could mean big things for Penfolds by giving it its own structure and governance, can this possible success lead to downstream benefits to TWE? If Penfolds is a real winner, why would TWE look to break it off? I have seen the reports and understand it's in their pipeline so I'm not disputing that it very well may happen, just interested in why they would choose to go this way.

2020-04-19	15:50:26	"I've not read much about the plan nor do I hold TWE so this is just me musing.

TWE must be thinking more value can attained when they  are seperated. Penfolds is their big brand but is heaped in with many others so its value is probably pushed down being lumped in within a large portfolio. 

If TWE retain a good % of Penfolds it will likely be beneficial by releasing considerable capital and increased value on what they retain.Win win (maybe)

They make more money on the many other lesser brands than Penfolds and may wish to redirect that capital more to those lesser brands. 

I have my reservations about separation.

I'd hate to see Penfolds end up in foreign hands"	sloppyrock	0

2020-04-18	21:48:46	"Alliance does a lot of flying on behalf of Virgin.

2020-04-18	23:09:09	"Key thing here is capital. 

Who would be willing to lend or give money to this company when the gov and banks won’t do it for Virgin?

2020-04-19	18:35:53	"IMO the nature of the beast (aviation) dictates that these things cant ramp up very quickly (even with the capital available).

2020-04-19	11:09:14	"Currently on a site serviced by Alliance, they have cut back a lot of the flights as there is a large reduction in the amount of workers coming in and out. You get a lot of FIFO workers from interstate and it’s not possible for them to come to work without spending 2weeks in the new state on their own dime. 
Our whole crew was panic flown up here the day after the border closure was announced and will be up here until they open up again. As opposed to the 7/7, 2/1 roster we were working before"	s0rryyournotawinner	0
2020-04-18	22:17:27	That's a fair consideration. Also notable that Qantas have a 20% ownership if alliance. But if their main customer base currently is FIFO, which I imagine the majority or flights are booked by businesses just looking for a good deal, do they really care about the brand? Winning the general public over though may be different. Good point	afternoondelite92	0
2020-04-19	01:29:32	Yes this is the gamble part of it for sure. I would hope the gov would consider helping them out if needed because competition is important. And considering they've been running a pretty successful airline so far, would hope they have the trust to be able to continue. QAN is good value yes, but we don't know when they're gonna start making money again. Alliance seem very shielded from covid so far meanwhile Qantas are pulling flights into regional areas that alliance fly to.	afternoondelite92	0
2020-04-19	13:02:14	"Government won’t help them, just like they won’t help Virgin.

Your investment thesis is based on growth in the company through acquisition and market share. That is going to require significant capex and will be time consuming. 

Whereas Qantas is ready to turn on the second demand comes back on, and at prices with no competition. 

The likely outcome here is Virgin is bought, restructured and then will take its place as the 2nd carrier again once things are back online.

I understand your point. But I believe there are too many variables, and this sounds more like a gamble as opposed to a solid investment thesis. However again, I wouldn’t be buying airlines."	athoughtfulusername	0

2020-04-17	23:51:04	"Yeah, although I wonder in the mining industry how much of a company’s success is due to the dumb luck of discovering a good site or running a mine that operates smoothly where products can be extracted easily and efficiently.

2020-04-18	05:11:34	Construction working well but in 6 months time it’s going to drop off a cliff. No one is doing new builds, projects, new houses estates etc. I work for a concrete company and we supply large civil contractors. Their current forward order book is 0 in September. Infrastructure structure spend will be huge but residential and commercial will be non existent	thepeteyboy	0
2020-04-18	08:21:41	"Here is my take on the two:

ABC:
- New management team have been there for under a year. Although new CEO is well regarded in the market. 
- Well positioned in the markets, however recent competition in the SA markets from a previous customer through the importing of bulker bag means that they are unlikely to see historical margins again for some time. 
- Typically have less exposure to the large end of town, specifically infrastructure.
- Corp governance considerations with the Barro family and bonuses paid to the outgoing CEO.

BLD: 
- Australian business has seen margin decline on falling prices and volumes.
- Large US exposure in a business that was overpaid for and isn’t delivering on targets, even in good times....
- CEO Kane set to leave the business in August. 
- Good asset base in Australia, this is the crown jewel in the business. 

Overall, BLD is better positioned to benefit from increased infra, which is where you could expect gov spending. However from a valuation perspective you wouldn’t ascribe much value to the US business - and you could see write downs in this business if a new CEO decides to wipe the slate clean. There is a reason it trades at a discount...

2020-04-17	17:34:09	Question about Westpac Trading	johnwhickkk77	1
2020-04-17	17:39:06	"It is possible that the purchase price includes the brokerage. So for example, if you buy 100 shares at $10 ($1000) plus $20 brokerage, the total cost base is $1020 which works out to be $10.20 per share.

Remember that for taxation purposes, brokerage costs (for buying and selling) form part of the cost base of the shares, so if you later sell them for $2000, you will only pay CGT on $2000 (selling amount) - $1000 (cost of shares) - $20 (buy brokerage) - $20 (sell brokerage) = $960.

2020-04-17	19:35:15	What's the base initial investment?	HelloStonehenge	1
2020-04-17	19:54:14	CommSec Pocket lets you make smaller investments from $50 to $1000 for $2.00 brokerage fees each transaction. However you only have 7 ETFs to choose from.	Worstmedicalstudent	0
2020-04-17	23:34:04	"I'd be careful about making trades smaller than $500 in general, just because brokerage makes earning a profit fairly difficult.   


A practical example:  
If brokerage is $10 per trade and you are investing $500, you will need a greater than 4% return to clear brokerage.   


The probability of earning this return in the short run isn't fantastic and the money you'd make if you held it in long run is arguably quite small.  


CommSec pocket or similar apps in my opinion are the way to go for trades less than $1000. Personally I am with SelfWealth and they offer a flat fee of $9.50 per trade, regardless of size. Send me a message if you're interested in them and I might be able to help you out!  


As always, this is my general opinion and doesn't take into account your personal circumstances."	burnttoast1944	0
2020-04-17	19:52:38	"$500 is the minimum to purchase stocks or etfs on ASX. Depending on your broker which I presume you are with Commsec.

""If you're a CHESS sponsored customer and settle through either your CDIA account or a CommSec margin loan account, you'll pay **$10** brokerage for trades of Australian shares up to $1,000. For trades between $1,000 and $10,000, you'll incur a $19.95 brokerage fee.""

Going by above $10.00 / $500 x 100% = 2% in brokerage. You will need your investment to go up 2% to breakeven.

Some brokers offer cheaper brokerage..."	bitzeroone	0

2020-04-18	03:53:08	Suggesting the same thing. With smaller investments Pocket is much better option, since $10 out of 500 is already 2%, and another $10 when selling, or $19.95 between 1-10k.	Lowells	0

Some of these retail shares are seen to be somewhat countercyclicle because people always need groceries so they tend to be included as a low risk portion of everyone's portfolio, which leads to such a high PE.

2020-04-17	17:25:59	"Fairly safe stock. Woolworths were under threat from Costco, Aldi, online shopping but overall they are a fairly well run company, with some ups and downs. 

Their dividend yield has fallen but that is in part because the stock price has risen, I guess in anticipation of dividend increases. I bought in at $27, should have topped up when they fell but didn’t. They are currently $10 higher. 

Pretty good for a blue chip dividend paying stock. Dividend, fully franked, more attractive than any bank interest."	willun	0
2020-04-17	19:32:53	"Tbh, I don’t think any of them have a competitive advantage... equally there could be other players coming online at any point in time- in those situations I own a small bag of a few of them. I hold COL and WOW because I don’t differentiate them at all. One thing to note is that COL whilst they aren’t the market leader, they actually pay a better dividend at 3.7%..

MTS doesn’t even appear on the radar for me. They lost the 7-11 contract and supply IGA. Whilst it’s nice for them to exist.. I don’t really see that they’re trying to get out of the convenience space.

This may be decades but the writing is already on the door. That said there is definitely some money to be made in the short - mid term.

2020-04-15	19:58:24	"Z1P is attractive in the short to medium term, but it needs to have a unique point of difference that it can actually advertise. Being more lenient with late fees is not something you actively want to advertise for obvious reasons. That can bring in customers who represent negative or very little customer lifetime value, and shareholders don't want to see a company basically giving away money.

Minimal fees is a good point since this will be important for businesses, but APT has a large enough network that they can reduce their fees to pressure Z1P out of the market. If these companies want to play a race to the bottom, then the smaller one with less capital will fold first. 

These companies need to strengthen exclusivity contracts and customer loyalty programmes, cross-promotions and adding value beyond the core product.

2020-04-15	21:07:15	"Z1p is an interesting one imo. 

In terms of Z1P vs APT, APT will inevitably grow to be much larger. Z1P has an incentives problem 

The monthly account fee means that Zip wants people to hold debts longer in order to make more money. They also want users to accumulate more debt to keep them paying longer. 
They can also then go to retailers and offer much lower transaction fees than Afterpay as they make their money from the user.

Afterpay one the other hand is doesn’t charge monthly fees and only deal with late fees as a deterrent. They want to be turning of the debts as rapidly as possible.  A 2% transaction fee turned over 12 times a year = a very nice return on your money. 

This was probably long winded but Z1P is cheap, will probably be alright through this period, but if I had to bet on one 10xing my money APT is the one."	kanyeeynak	0

I have to disagree. If people are foolish enough to trust un-verified randoms on the internet, they are clearly in the wrong lane. I don't have to defend this reasoning, it has been brought up numerous times on this page.   
I don't need to see your err 'mathematics'. I am well aware of the nuances and theoretical underpinning of stock valuation. I was merely gauging opinions of the future projection of a stock which I believe currently to be severely undervalued.

2020-04-15	21:02:54	"LGP Holder Here. 

I actually purchased LGP - Little Green Pharma on the second opening day, I paid approx 10% over IPO price which I am still holding. I have seen this stock get to it's all time low at 0.18 cents seeing your stock drop nearly 65% is not easy to stomach. 

There are quite a few Cannabis companies here in Australia, what led me to this company is that they are the only company in Australia to grow it locally while other's are mainly researchers or imports. There products can be purchased if you have a special script, but with current legislation with M.J makes thing's a bit harder for it to become available to every one access just for general purposes unless it becomes legislated like we see in Canada. 

In order for Australian companies to prosper Cannabis needs to be fully lifted, medical and recreational to maximise profits but again this will interfere with Big Pharma's. 

How ever there facility can produce up to 110,000 bottles per year and able to ship out ""x"" tones of dry herb out to Europe. They have a few deals going on with Germany and UK. 

Bright future ahead but revenue is still very low, not much cash in the bank which could soon dry out if they aren't getting in though enough sales. 

Will be interested to see when they release there quarterly and annual reports. 

I am not planning to sell this any time soon, but I would project them to possibly get back to IPO Price $0.45 cents to $.50 cents by the end of the year.

I had a quick 5 min look and saw they announced an equity raise but i couldn't confirm both the institutional and retail shares on offer had been issued yet.  If not,  there is dilution on the horizon for share holders so that should be factored when considering how the share price will recover.	asparagusm	0

I agree. I see plenty of people wearing them on the street. They seem to be edging out north face in the Aussie market and are moving more and more into casual wear as they establish their brand. I'm going to buy up next time they dip below 0.60 - 0.65. Wait until they release more metrics on their COVID financials.

I found this from my broking platform re point 1 (DRP shares being visble) - 

""How do I transfer my Issuer Sponsored shares to over to ANZ Share Investing?

There are two ways to transfer your Issuer Sponsored shares over to ANZ Share Investing.

You can submit a transfer request online by [logging into your account](https://webauthecc.anz.com/oamfed/idp/initiatesso?providerid=CMCShareInvesting&adobe_mc=MCMID%3D12041378846482085082330042175678568998%7CMCAID%3D2D96F008052C6312-400000C1000002A0%7CMCORGID%3D67A216D751E567B20A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1586868923), and selecting 'Account', then 'Transfer Securities'.

You can also complete the [Issuer Conversion Form (PDF 152kB)](https://trading.anzshareinvesting.com.au/APP_Themes/ANZ/PDF/ANZ-Issuer-to-CHESS-conversion.pdf) and email to [service@anzshareinvesting.com](mailto:service@anzshareinvesting.com)""

Sounds a bit annoying and probably fees involved.

The Growth figures are bs in my option as they can't possible predict industry specific outcomes, there are to many variables."		0
2020-04-13	18:59:48	I don't understand the value that simplywall st put on stonks. I imagine its all based off financials from half year reports so its outdated. Add in COVID-19 and its not only outdated, its plain wrong. Doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with those stocks just that you probably need another way to derive an intrinsic value.	arctic_win	0
2020-04-13	16:37:57	"I'm not sure I agree with the logic... 

Look at Briscoes, they sell shit at 65% discounts all the time and still manage to have people come back to purchase more. This tactic is pretty well explained in this video: (Fastforward to 35secs in)

It's the most well known brand in New Zealand for hiking gear, you've got 4million people basically on house arrest... What do you think is gonna happen when they're let out? ""Let's get the fuck away for the weekend...""

I doubt they'll struggle to move stock."		0

It really depends on the time horizion but is true. I'm gonna sit on my shares and wait for these antibody experiments, if they give the all clear Australia might open up a little sooner then the rest of the world so can take advantage of the shortages in raw materials.

I'm not as concerned with Covid-19 as I am with how long the government takes to remove restrictions."		0

The business model seems quite smart and the company has done a fantastic job of keeping their clients up to date with the latest restrictions which will generate a lot of good will.


I can't see them struggling financially, unfortunately they just got caught up in the storm..

I'll probably buy back in if the price drops."		0

I wondered about your perspective on the company, not the stock. Thanks."	newagefunk	0
2020-04-14	03:50:57	"Ok, well I gave you a company summary so I assume you want financials.

2018 -> 2019 Financial year
Revenue up 20%
Profit up 11%
Cash: $138m up from $84m

Seems to be growing at around 20% annually (before Covid obviously lol)."		0
2020-04-14	07:38:39	"Thanks, I got a firm hand on financials though. Wondered whether you might have looked at the company and story in more detail. I have looked at the annual reports a while back and didn’t like the amount of adjustments they make to key metrics. 

In terms of Webjet, I personally don’t like that the company gave the CEO a loan, don’t remember whether it was = > < market rates, and especially the fact that the company keeps adjusting key metrics by removing acquisitions. then elsewhere they write that acquisitions are a key part of their business model. 

-› Alas, if acquisitions are a key part, why the heck do they not matter when reporting key metrics? Not surprising that the stock got pummeled recently."	newagefunk	0
2020-04-14	19:00:31	"My experience is primarily in Telco's, Healthcare and Mining (Gold, Iron Ore, etc) so I can't speak to the exact metrics CTD is using or adjusting. 

However, selective reporting is pretty commonplace and if it was of any major concern the auditing team would have highlighted it. When I was younger I did some part-time advisory work for a not for profit who regularly chose not to disclose donations until the next financial year as they knew it would affect how much they'd get in donations for the coming financial year. I don't think this is any different, every publicly traded company is shit scared of publishing anything which would impact the share-price so sometimes being sneaky is required.

&#x200B;

As far as Webjet goes, A CEO who spends more then he makes is surprisingly common as they get used to such a high cash flow  (same with doctors) so a small personal loan wouldn't concern me that much. 

I'd just keep an eye on general financials, Webjet is a very risky share to purchase given the current restrictions (hence why I only hold a few $1000 in shares). You're buying it on the chance of getting significant returns in 6-12 months if you want peace of mind don't purchase it lol."		0

2020-04-13	08:54:33	Qantas is a Flag Carrier and was state owned until 1992. The Commonwealth Government has no strategic control of the airline.	outragez_guy	0
2020-04-13	13:21:02	You are correct. They've not owned Qantas since 1995. The Qantas sale act states it must remain majority Australian owned but there is no government ownership.	sloppyrock	0

2020-04-13	17:07:11	"That shouldn't worry you. Buy for the long term!

In the short term you are most likely going to loss money. Even if the price drops buy more when you can. 

The market goes down 20%ish then they printed upwards of 2ish trillions dollars. They will do everything in there power to push the market up. 

Plus trying to time the market is a bad idea, look at the graph today the bottom has been and gone.

 If you want shorter term look at single stocks that will live after this down fall. They will have greater increases then etfs."	dudweb	0

2020-04-12	23:12:59	"Well you'd find that the likelihood of their collections will fall as people will have less money. If their collections fall, so too will their profit and dividend (and maybe value of assets as they will be written down).

Maybe long term they are a good buy but be very weary of the past data of this company in the current economic climate."	illwillspills	0
2020-04-13	02:27:58	"What you need to know about CCP;

1. Very conservative, sensible management. CEO's nickname is St Thomas of Beregi
2. They tested going to USA over a couple of years. Test worked. Now scaling. They can buy debt cheaper in the US than Australia. This will x5 or x10 the business over the next decade.
3. Directors have bought post Covid. They know what is going on.
4. Debt collection is recession proof, or even negatively correlated. Debt might be harder to collect - you just need to incorporate that in the price u buy it at. In a recession - there is more debt to buy and therefore lower prices."	watobay	0
2020-04-13	00:16:28	I think now in recession collections may either slow down or pick up greatly cause people will be spending less, and if they are spending they will be putting it on credit.	mikewilliamz	0
2020-04-13	00:29:27	"Their revenue has increased year after year since 2009, their long term debt and gearing have recently decreased, their cash assets have been increasing and their dividends have increased year after year for 10 years. They’ve been around since 1992 too.

Looks like a very boring and good, solid company. Apart from big crashes and recessions which inherently hurts their earning capacity, they are looking like a pretty solid buy for long hold potentially."	d-pre	0
2020-04-12	21:46:50	Also thinking about owning some, looks like a solid company	smalldog00	0
2020-04-12	22:14:05	"yes, I hold quite a bit, pretty good...if they survived the GFC they should survive everything else. Only downside is they get hit hard during recessions so you have to pull out early.

2020-04-13	02:23:33	Held them numerous times and will hold again in the future. Imo, they are a long term hold and as others have said their performance will suffer a bit. Likely be some good entry points coming up but to be fair the current price is decent.	Grunewalder	0

2020-04-13	02:30:05	People are less likely to pay - obviously. So obviously that it gets incorporated into the price they buy debt at. Solved. Recessions means more business need t collect. CCP just buys at a price they know they can collect at.	watobay	0
2020-04-12	23:19:01	So the long and short (sorry, pun) of it is that they do well when people have earning capacity. Got it.	d-pre	0
2020-04-13	03:51:27	How do you know all this info? Not doubting, just genuinely curious.	d-pre	0
2020-04-13	04:08:21	Yes, but lenders will be more reluctant to both extend credit and to dun it. Public relations is important to most companies, and sending half their clients to collections is a bad look. The major banks have access to cheap credit from the RBA, so from their perspective it's likely better to retain impaired debt on their books longer than usual rather than accepting significant writedowns	Kyanar	0
2020-04-12	22:08:22	I mean...people will always be in debt right?!	d-pre	0
2020-04-12	22:34:16	"So they purchase small business and consumer debt from banks, telcomms, utility companies and financial companies and then do the chasing up, earning interest on the debt purchase along the way, is that correct? Is that their business model? Excuse my idiocy, just wanna be clear.

And is the rationale for them not doing well in recessions because there is simply less debt going around because people aren’t borrowing?"	d-pre	0

2020-04-13	03:10:05	True, but when will they pay? Once we get dates of the restrictions lifting and people can work. This stock should go up, in theory. Although, the virus may be beaten in the short term. Restarting the economy and reducing fear of going out will require more effort	obeymypropaganda	0
2020-04-13	00:34:33	">rationale for them not doing well in recessions because there is simply less debt going around because people aren’t borrowing

CWY - Aus biggest waste management provider. Waste management is going to be increasingly important and they are well positioned to do well. Quite defensive too - always going to need our rubbish dealt with. They are also planning on doing some innovative things - such as a plant that will turn waste into energy. If that takes off if could be huge.

2020-04-11	03:26:50	As far as I can see, Z1P is a decent enough investment in the short to medium term. They don't have a huge overseas presence, and with the expectation of other established entrants into the market, I think the smaller players will eventually fall to the side. It's a difficult product for a truly unique selling point, so the leader will probably be the one with the lowest costs to businesses and the best rewards/loyalty programme and cross-promotions for users. I'm personally going in on Z1P in the short term, but I can't see it being a long term investment.	ZestyBreh	0

Interesting about CWY - how do you feel Visy plays into this or are they different? Dealing with our waste ethically/resourcefully/efficiently is definitely only getting bigger! But I suppose could come at a big cost if the government doesn't help out.

Thats not really true..."	akkatracker	0
2020-04-11	16:09:15	"Ok, two very different companies here & I've included the KPIs that are important to me.

GOR - will be a solid mid tier producer, hasn't hit nameplate yet. Excellent management and steady performance. 880m shares on issue, $1.4b MC. AISC of $1150 ($1600 AUD clear per Oz) about normal amount of shares on issue so good liquidity. I expect steady growth in share price.

RML - Speculative/high risk, have bought into a deal with Millrock and own land surrounding NST's Pogo gold mine. Early drilling was cut short by COVID but looks to be the same geological system. A great story & I recommend watching some of the Millrock videos. Assay results in 3 weeks. Low amount of shares on issue, I expect big moves up or down in share price. Champagne or real pain.

Both could turn to xxx if gold crashes so do your own research. You have to have a think about where the gold price is going, AUD to USD and risk."	DMlab	0
2020-04-11	01:24:51	"Some stocks 'swing' up and down multiple times a day, this is otherwise known as volatility. CSL volatility is quite high (being the biggest stock on the ASX) and therefore you can predict the movements and profit from it without even really spending money. Example is yesterday when it went between $314 and $329 a unit twice in just a single day.

Other stocks (such as SUL, MQG) have similarly high volatility scores too.

Buy $10,000 worth at $314, sell at $329. Profit. ($465)
Stock goes back down to say $316, buy again. Wash, repeat.

A tad risky... the catch is that if you don't sell... you have to settle the money... but also the stock isn't a bad hold anyway... and it it almost certain to go up in time."	HeckingLoveDogs	0

I’d link the article, but it’s paywalled unless I’m at work.

There were mining explosive companies.
SUL (Super retail group).
JBH even (I would love this to happen).

They could go for something complementary to their existing war chest or springboard into a new market."	HeckingLoveDogs	0

The market is very volatile and no one knows which way it will go. That said I agree with your fundamental analysis, and whilst the market responds to future expectations, it doesn’t seem to be reflecting the negatives in the short to medium term.

2020-04-10	16:10:02	"I think we're seeing these little surges in Australia because we just don't know what a bear market looks like and the ""buy at a discount"" and ""greed when others are fearful"" mentality is rife.

Basically, everyone assumes everyone else is being fearful, when everyone is being greedy.

Reasons to be positive:

* China returning to normal and manufacturing is starting up again
* Stimulus pacakges are in place to cushion the blow
* So far, the only businesses massively affected appear to be airlines, hospitality and cruises (that's not to say others aren't, but this seems to be the focus).
* We can still dig shit out of the ground and sell it

Reasons to be negative/sceptical/cautious

* The unemployment rate for April hasn't been reported and a trend hasn't really been established. Will the rate increase or decrease?
* If this stimulus isn't strong enough, is there enough in the coffers for another round?
* Social distancing has been in place for around a month in other countries and doesn't look like it'll be stopping. We've only just started distancing.
* Consumer confidence has crashed and people have already bought their WFH setups. People with money can't exactly go on holiday and you can only buy so many TVs and streaming subscriptions. Shopping centres are effectively closed.
* Even though we have a stimulus, it's taking some time to get out and the government doesn't have a great track record in massive technological projects.

All this is to say, the market is only detached from reality if the reality becomes us seeing an uptick in cases, protracted social distancing, and really poor numbers in the coming weeks. If the ""she's right"" crowd are correct, then it's the doomers and gloomers who are detached."	theresnorevolution	0

2020-04-10	02:11:02	Markets are forward looking and have stopped reacting to news for now. We had a rapid, unprecedented decline that may be correcting and it’s looking like investors are seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. That said, markets were overvalued at the beginning of the crash. I‘m of the belief we will either continue on a flat or downward trend for an extended period (give or take a few bull/bear runs). There is government money being pumped into markets, a reasonable chance of more coronavirus drama (e.g. 2nd wave of outbreaks in China) and uncertainty on the long term economic effects of the pandemic. I agree that the short term swings are irrational and won’t be trying to profit off them.	lach1134	0

2020-04-10	07:12:30	Make no mistake, the economic fallout from what is occurring right now has not even begun to manifest. Central banks around the world have lost control of the system they created. Governments will only be able to bail out their people for a finite amount of time, and once the money dries up and the mass defaults begin, banks around the world will start to fail like a house of cards. The funny money being injected into the global financial system right now is like shot after shot of adrenaline. A temporary fix to a deeper, systemic rot.

2020-04-12	16:26:06	I agree that current market price is not indicative of the looming economic fallout. I also believe that too many people are black or white on this issue when it is in fact a grey area that no one has the answer to. This is unprecedented. The spanish flu of 18'-20' which killed 2% of the worlds population did not induce volatility in markets whereas word of covid spreading from mainland china to the west in early 2020 saw volatility peak to the likes of the 87' crash and in the 'great crash' of 1929 leading into the great depression. While all past crashes have had one thing in common, they were caused by economic drivers, this crash was not. It was induced by fear. We have yet to see the economic onflow of debt and entire industries and in some cases entire countries grinding to a halt. The level of globalisation of economies is sure to compound these negative impacts. All listed companies can do for now is remove guidance. If specialist companies with indepth analysis of their respective industries cant predict what's coming, how can anyone predict the subsequent macro environment? People are very excited about the discounted price of solid companies, when in fact their market prices have re-alligned with 2017/2018 levels. This is around the same time alot of experts believed the market moved into overvalued territory. So if anything we are back to where we should be without an ongoing global disaster. Im only a humble long term retail investor, and i continue to dollar-cost-average into the market. I do however believe there is alot more short-term pain to be felt. I hope im wrong. The central banks have been altering the economic cycles for too long, we are well overdue to see out an entire cycle. This however is not cyclical.	jonesy991	0

2020-04-10	14:59:38	"Oh yes, slowing coronavirus cases in a few countries, let the market rally. What about the economic disaster that follows. Planes are literally grounded worldwide, sports stadiums are empty, shops are shut. Yet the worst we get is a 30% flash crash? Despite an inevitable recession, company earnings through the floor, business going bankrupt, record high corporate and personal debt, declining consumer confidence, record high unemployment claims all over the world etc. all coming off an overvalued market in the first place. People buying because “the market is down 30% so it’s cheap” is illogical, price and valuation is not synonymous. Kind of like my co-workers co come to me and say “I was gonna buy Qantas last week and now it’s up!” When the last market rally was multiple expansion rather than fundamental growth it’s obvious we really haven’t fallen that far anyway. 

In terms of the virus itself, we really don’t have enough evidence to say that we’re slowing it worldwide. Some countries have before it’s taken off such as Australia, South Korea and Japan. Others after it’s already been too late like Italy, China (wouldn’t believe their numbers) and other European countries. U.S is still growing, and it’s likely conservative due to lack of mass testing. It’s the economic issues that are present because of the virus which will be a problem. 

What do you think is the best case scenario? I believe it’s controlling the virus in 6-8 months and a recession. That doesn’t sound like a 30% crash at the start of the year followed by a recovery to me. So yes, I don’t think it makes sense. Call me crazy but I believe it’s rational. Not to say I’m not buying or that I’m short because I don’t try to time the market. I just don’t believe this rally is sustainable in my opinion and it’s fun to at least have an opinion. Then again, I’ve been thinking the housing market is too expensive for a long time and it seems to defy any logical reasoning."	vBocaj	0
2020-04-10	15:25:32	"That would be right... if  ""Corona rate of infection slows during complete lockdown = ASX recovery and recession canceled.""

Unfortunately, the global and economic situation is more complex. Without a vaccine or treatment, nothing has changed and we're essentially looking at everyone worldwide getting exposed to this at somepoint over the next couple years, the death rate from infection (via WHO) is averaging 3.4%.  Once it takes off in poorer more populous countries, that is going to skyrocket. That's a lot of dead people.

Invest what you're willing to lose also allows for major gap downs, like imagine if you invested just before this big drop and you were leveraged to the tits? You think the broker cares? They want their money back. If you cant live without $500 less, then use a stop loss for $500 and dont leverage.

Leveraging is the perfect example of a way to try get rich quick. Yet most people who are leveraged are the idiots who shouldn't be. Most people dont put in days/weeks of research into a company, its values, does it have a moat, does it suit their risk tolerance, do they want a dividend and so on.

They now have cash to come out swinging but at a heavy dilution to existing shareholders and had to give up equity.

I'm not yet familiar with the FLT package but FLT has been run so well for decades. Senior management team has largely been intact for 30 years. They have an excellent balance sheet and there is a reason they have always been well liked by fund managers and investors - stable management and growth on growth every year.

You should also look to diversify into international stocks (either through ASX listed ETFs or stocks through a broker which supports investment in overseas markets).

Do you already have a property under your name and is this your second one, will you have a place to stay and enough money for living expenses if the market turns to shit, if this is your second property are you treating it as an investment property.) Personally, I’d buy a house first (I’m still far off from making that type of money, unfortunately) for some stability. If I’m staying in one of the rooms, rent the other room and maybe garage or parking space out. Safe recurring revenue on those, then  profits from that will go into saving up for the next property or the stock market. I continue to invest money into stocks myself but that’s because I don’t have a large enough amount for a property yet.

Yes it's a gold stock and should well insulated in unpredictable times, but offhand I can't think of another Mid Cap miner that has had that combination of shocks.

Unfortunately as it is a managed find it means you don't have much choice, but the benefit of spaceship, is that there are no fees under 5k (I think). You can also set up a investment plan.

2020-04-08	21:23:30	I’d add one of the big 4 banks to your portfolio just for long term investing. They’re all pretty discounted at the moment. CBA was around $85-$90 before the crash and is hovering around $60 atm. But if you’re looking for something to trade I’d think maybe WOW or COL, since they’re profiting pretty well lately and their next earnings report is going to look good. Hell, the Woolworths in my area did more sales in 1 week of March than they did over the entirety of the Christmas holidays.

 In a bear market these companies are the first to really struggle, and will find it difficult to grow if not just stay at the level they are.

2020-04-08	18:53:36	I disagree. Small caps and growth are not synonymous. Value small/micro caps outperform almost every other part of the stock market, especially during bear markets. This is why value investors thrived in the 2000’s. Small cap growth are the first to fail, they’re the ones who rely on capital the most. We’ve just had one of the greatest bull markets and large/mega caps far outperformed small/micro caps. Mostly because it was a growth market, and large cap growth stocks outperformed everything.	vBocaj	0

Given that webjet’s pricing model necessarily results in higher prices than buying direct, what reason will future customers have for choosing them? People now perceive that travel agents are less help than going direct. Webjet has no brick and mortar stores for people who want to deal with a smiling face. They’re more expensive.

Until then, they're just going to be bleeding cash. Not sure how the balance sheet works with everyone being given credit for cancelled trips. But potentially no new revenue for some time with people just using credit for bookings in the next 12 month's?

So in other words. Risk is probably still to the downside in the near term. I don't see any rush to get in just yet."	Sawltea	0

But they are involved with all the above mentioned games and have some decent partnerships to host tournaments starting to come through now. E.g. Microsoft to host Age of Empires tournaments.

They've got an app coming to market soon too. Think they're going after the mobile esports market share. Do you know if that subset of esports is a big deal?"	thedarkpass3nger	0
2020-04-08	00:16:10	"Age of Empires 2 eSports is actually becoming a thing these days, the Hidden Cup event hosted a few weeks back got 60K+ viewers on Twitch which is pretty decent but its definitely not even close to what constitutes popular eSports.

Overwatch League only recently turned profitable and only for several teams iirc, other teams still not yet achieving profits.

As for mobile esports, honestly no. It isn't a big deal and funny enough I personally had involvements with Clash of Clans eSports, and many of the content creators that worked with my clan personally have now moved on to PUBG and other mobile games, including Powerbang which is one of the more famous mobile game eSport related individuals.

For these companies, at a quick glance they both have low market caps but need to check if SOI is high or not. If the balance sheet isn't pretty what will occur is repeated CRs, you will need to check management's history of executing these CRs and if they are heavily discounted etc, the company will go nowhere.

Is there a path to profitability? Like most specs, probably not. If there are any pump catalysts for these kinds of stocks it would be working with large eSports organizations like Faze Clan, Envy, T1 etc or getting deals with the large league franchises like OWL.

When the media discusses the growing popularity of eSports, they are mostly referring to established large leagues like the Overwatch League, which have companies like Comcast and high net worth names like Robert Kraft of the Patriots owning teams.

A PUBG mobile tournament lets say honestly is not going to garner anything close to that level of support and revenues, and for companies that aren't FCF+ there will just be infinite CRs until the company is diluted into oblivion unless they are able to get a major partnership or deal beforehand.

IMO.

(Edit: Easy way to tip whether the market any of these companies is going for is a good idea or not is where it is located. South Korea is one of the best if not the best market for eSports due to popularity and establishment, then China, EU and NA.)

Anything outside of that simply doesn't have the market or establishment for major eSports, and the rest that aren't major eSports don't make enough money. I feel that in this space, many can be suckered into flashy looking or sounding deals without realizing whether the game or league in mention is actually relevant)"	Exalted_HC	0

With regard to your decision buying Woodside/oil stocks on the basis that oil will recover, remember that that’s entirely contingent on either a demand increase, or the Saudis stopping flooding the market with supply. The reality of the situation is that neither you, nor me, nor the best analyst at the best hedge fund in the world knows when the oil price war will end, if at all. It’s ultimately up to the Saudis who have a chokehold on supply, and are bending the market to their will. 

So you’ve got your 10k and say you invest it in oil shares and  oil goes back up tomorrow. Congratulations, you’ve made a tidy profit! Now say the price war drags on forever, to the point where electric vehicles have now become the norm, the world is running off renewables and as a result the oil that has flooded the worlds economy is now almost completely worthless. Then we have a problem! 

This shows the extra risk you take on by investing all your money in one company. If their business model becomes unprofitable, you as the investor take a big hit as well. The key lies in diversification, and there are ways of achieving that through the stock market. 

Index funds are used to track certain companies in the stock market, and different indexes exist for different purposes. Vanguard Australian Shares or VAS for short is an index that tracks the top 300 companies in Australia, and allows you to buy a single unit at $65ish dollars a share that gives you instant exposure to all 300 companies! This way, you reduce your risk by owning companies in a range of sectors. 

A lot of data exists out there showing that the average investor doesn’t beat the market over time (I.e. the average investor achieves a worse return than they would have got if they had just bought an index of the market they had invested in). Buying and holding indexes is a time tested method, and as an introduction to share investing its a great place to start.

Good luck!"	7Lunchboxes	0
2020-04-07	00:29:35	"Hi mate, congrats on taking the step into shares! 

With regards to your first purchase you've got a couple of options, and personally I wouldn't dump it all into WPL. If I were you I'd have a look at [Vangard's ETF options](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/list#/etf/asset-class/month-end-returns) (there's a reason /r/AusFinance loves them) to find the one that best suits your preferences. Ausfinance would tell you to dump it all in there to set and forget, but I totally understand wanting to play stock picker with some cash, as it keeps you engaged and learning. VAS, VGH and VDHG are some of the more popular options, however there's a whole range out there depending on your preferences. As Wu-Tang Financial taught us, it's [important to diversify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce33LQm98I0), so you don't have all your eggs in one basket. 

If you want to have a crack at WPL consider putting $1000-$2000 into it and the rest into an ETF. Take some time to learn how to read a balance sheet and a P&L statement, using WPL as your example. It's a great tool to have in your arsenal when investing your next $10k, or the $10k after that.

Finally have a look at [Passive Investing Australia](https://www.passiveinvestingaustralia.com/) which has some very solid advise on investing across a number of markets. 

Best of luck with it, and for the love of god stay away from BBUS and BBOZ."	ItsDeathBySnuSnu	0

Oil is in such over-supply that landlocked oil-rigs are PAYING others to take their stock away, there's just nowhere to store the oil.  
For god sakes do not under any circumstances buy an Australian oil company. We do not have a good track history on oil.

It's shocking how many people think we've hit the bottom and want to buy in now.

Here's an entre\` to feast on; Unemployment numbers will be out in 2 weeks, we could very well see a rise from 5.2% to at least 7.5%, with future numbers planned by the government (specifically Josh Frydenberg) of up to +1m job losses, which would put us at 12% in the next 1-3 months.

I didn't want to assume we had hit rock bottom yet. I thought by only investing half of what I have set aside now, I might be able to at least hedge my bets. If it drops further, potential to buy even cheaper and if things start to recover at least I got my foot in the door at a good price.

I might be looking at it all wrong, but see two possibilities. 
Investing now and losing my savings (happened to me during the GFC).
Not investing and missing out on a pretty rare opportunity should things recover.

I don't really know. An ETF or Indexed fund feels kind of like a safety net. Given my lack of experience, exposure to the top 200 companies seems like a good idea. I'm basing that purely on the belief/assumption that the ASX200 will inevitably recover, eventually. 

But also investing directly in some blue chip shares from various sectors I assume would be a sensible approach, so as to not just throw all my money into one fund or index.

I guess my real motivator is how far the ASX200 has fallen and my assumption that it will recover. Would you advise against the idea of buying a range blue chip shares from various sectors and simply holding on?

I assume that years from now the ASX200 will probably be trading higher than it is now and I might have turned some savings into a little more savings.

This is probably offensively simplistic a thought process. But I'm not smart enough or motivated enough to trade like you do. I'm hoping I might just be smart enough to recognise an opportunity that doesn't come around all that often.

Downturn and current crisis aside, investing for long term growth in blue chip companies can't be a terrible idea, can it?"	compleks_inc	0

2020-04-07	19:23:54	"Gracias.

My dilemma is that I'm constantly hearing the whole ""no one has a crystal ball"" mantra. On top of that, anywhere I look or ask, I can find vastly differing opinions on absolutely anything, from seemingly credible sources. Even worse is that people touting opposite advice can both be deemed successful in their approach.

It's a complicated rabbit hole for the uninformed.

This is why I'm suggesting to invest some of my savings now, or soon, while the market is down. Because I don't know for a fact that things will get worse and lack the knowledge and experience to make a genuinely confident and informed call on what the market will do.

I am however reasonably confident that in the future, however distant, it will recover.

I will only loose money if the market keeps going down and I decide to sell, which I can't foresee happening. Or if things go completely bust and we enter a complete depression or pre-apocalyptic world (probably not that far off).

I will retain half of my savings so that I can top up my shares in the future. If the market goes down further, I can top up. If it starts recovering, I can top up.

I will give you first rights to say ""I told you so"" if things go pear shaped.

As others have pointed out, I reckon both are going to struggle in the short to medium term due to their connection to consumer discretionary spend. Taking a longer term view with the information that we have now, I do like Afterpay a little bit better because

* They are in the US, UK and NZ market and are the leader in the space in AU.
* From a value proposition perspective, retailers want to sign up with them because they have a larger consumer base, and consumers want to sign up with them because they have a larger network of stores which accept them (and this effects kinda just compounds on itself as the network gets larger)

I personally think that if one were in invest in such a saturated market (I think there's like 5 or 6 listed BNPL companies on the ASX now, e.g. Splitit, Openway), investors wouldn't want to own anything less than the second player in the market and APT and Z1P are the top 2 in the AU market.

I also not sure what level of the impact the COVID-19 will have on the company's revenue, bad debts etc, it will be interesting when these companies release quarterly business updates over the next month. This will be a good opportunity to test your assumptions against what the company is saying and perhaps then the decision will be much clearer.

They have an update coming this month which I think will be well received and I like the management team and new leaders that they have poached from regulators to assist with those issues.

I don't really get the hate for BNPL providers given the low cost to the consumer and that 80%+ of their profits come from the merchant fees. In turn, the merchant gets increased revenue and customer traffic via APT marketing channels.

ZipMoney is considered a credit product which means that it has to adhere to the Credit Act. Afterpay's product is not considered credit, nor is ZipPay. Just something to consider when you in the future you hear stuff about regulation in the industry.

There’s 10 other things that I’d be buying before even considering BNPL services. They’re just way too speculative, too many unknowns and risky from a regulatory perspective.

After the best part of a week, she’d made enough trades and gained enough trader points to qualify for the bonus, and the money just appeared in her trading account.

The link posted in an earlier comment has info about the different trader point goals for different bonus promotion, and I think there’s a link in there that does tell you the amount of trader points for different companies that you can trade.

2020-04-03	22:06:00	"Biggest drop since 1929. How bad do you think it's going to get? 

Projections look like 6 months max. Great depression was downwards for three years with another two for recovery. 

How long are you holding you positions for? How much affect do you think this will have on your positions in 5 years from now? 20 years from now?

Sure quite a few businesses are going to liquidate, but why would you invest in them? 

So many people saying 'there's still more to come' but everyone is aware of that, hence so much is priced in. If there's a spike in cases, will any investor think 'shit I didn't see that coming'. 2020 earnings losses are already priced in, case spikes are priced in, unemployment rates are priced in, bailouts priced in. 

What is it that you're referring to that 'surely cannot be priced in'? I don't mean that in a snarky way at all, I just love the ongoing discussion of which direction it's going to go.

My view is that in order to get the most gains you need to treat every bound as a reversal with strict stops. The attitude that it 'can't go up' is how most are going to miss out on the best prices."	AcidUrine	0

Picking the bottom is stupid, a lot of people have their money ready to go and their finger on the button ready to buy.

2020-04-04	20:18:47	""" Projections look like 6 months max ""

I'm not sure where the consensus for 6 months max is? Scomo is signalling 6 months of disruption, without providing any further detail on why 6 months, and if it will mean simply easing the current restrictions, or a full resumption of all activity. Will international flights resume? Will sporting events and concerts resume?

As Fauci said, we don't set the timeline, the virus does. In 6 months, we will still be a long way away from the most optimistic outlooks for a vaccine and will not have herd immunity. 

The difference from today is that we will have passed the peak of new daily infections in many countries, and most developed countries would have made some impact (at various levels of success) in flattening the curve and reducing the impact on their health systems.

At this point, what could logically follow is the 'dance'  that will occur across rich countries - targeted lifting of restrictions, and measuring the impact on new infections that will inevitably pop up. As infections rise again, restrictions will go back up. Rinse and repeat. 

This could go on for a really long time, because it seems pretty much impossible to get actual (not just tested/confirmed) cases to zero across the world. 

On the subject of a vaccine - it should be noted that a successful vaccine has never been created for a coronavirus. The 12-18 month predictions are based on the trials that have started in the last few months turning out to be successful. The chances of this are very hard to nail down with any level of confidence because there is no prior data.

We also cannot think about the 6 month period from today in a vaccuum. The shutdowns are having many many 2nd order, 3rd order and so on effects. What will happen when you combine 30% unemployment in the US, large rates of gun ownership, president Trump, an upcoming election and the National Guard on the streets ensuring populations are quarrentining inside their homes? Are current prices factoring in widespread civil unrest and violence in the US?

The other big unknown is how deeply the virus is going to effect poor countries with large populations that cannot afford to quarrentine for extended periods. What kind of refugee situation is this going to create from Africa into Europe, or South America to North America? Today's 1m cases number will look like nothing if the expert opinion on 40-80% of the world's population contracting the virus.

This is uncharted territory."	mugmo123	0

- housing down (which leads to construction down, probably banking down)
- tourism is massive for parts of Aus - down

Also will not at all be surprised to see a GFC 2.0 event from something lurking in our financial system - totally nefarious and mysterious comment but honestly I'd be willing to gamble on it at least a little..

Of course most of the info I’m reading pertains to the US market, and I don’t completely understand how the US market correlate to AU.

As you said, AU somehow went through 2008 relatively unscathed, although the stock market took a hit to a similar extent as the US (please correct if I got that wrong). That left AU with unresolved, escalating household debt-to-GDP (around 120-180% depending on source) and public debt-to-GDP (although lower than most OECD countries). I’m not sure how much burn time companies, individuals and even the government has, given this level of debt. How much QE can AU do? We’re already at 0.25% interest rates.

Ok mate.

Go look up SWINGFISH. He exclusively trades VWAP TA and live streams 6hrs-10hrs each day the last 3 years.
Zero fundamental analysis, and runs his own prop firm and handles tens of millions of dollars.

But no, you're right. Technical analysis doesn't work if you've done it for 2 months and blown out your trading account.

There's literally no other answer to that question first question.

As for rationale, the idea behind it is that the asx200 simply isnt worth 4800 at the time. The market over reacts then recovers as a result. 
Companies don't have 40% decline in assets, cash, equity and revenues all at once within a month.

They may have that in 4 - 6 months.
People buy in on the oversold stocks for the existing value they have. If they've only lost 10-15% in the first month on the above metrics, 40% is simply too big or a drop.

Qantas for example dropped almost to asset backing valuation. Which by any market metric is stupidly oversold. Hence the bounce.

Any heavy overselling on large cap stocks WILL bounce to 50% unless exceptional circumstances like delisting occurs."	ASXXXThrowaway	0

2020-04-03	19:41:37	"> How does the sale usually take place and through what platform?

You should receive an offer document which you can ignore or elect to take part. You can likely elect how many extra shares you wish to buy up to your limit. You can't trade the entitlement stock. 

> Is my allocation guaranteed or is it a race I will instantly lose to bigger investors?

Not a race, your entitlement is an entitlement. You choose if or how much you take up. If you do no take up any or all the offer , those shares maybe be offered to other institutions (afaik.)

> How long does it take for me to claim the shares, and am I able to sell the shares I buy through it straight away on the ASX and make an instant profit, assuming they are trading above $1.70?

When you see them in your account you can trade them.

> The Record Date for the offer is listed as end of day today, yet the offer opens on April 8th. At what point in time is my one-to-one allocation determined

Record date. The share registry gathers all the required info about those holders and what stock they own and send out offer documents to those eligible holders. 

> if I sold most of my shares next week, would I still be entitled to the amount I originally held at the end of day today?

I believe that is the case, record date is record date. They must rule a line there somewhere.  

There will be dilution so be aware of that dynamic. Cap raisings can create  volatility. I would not hazard a guess as to how this will pan out. A successful institutional offer is a good sign and will give the market some confidence. Enough for how long? No idea.

I'm not a trained pro, so its not advice as such."	sloppyrock	0

I am long on CGC so wasn't interested in selling immediately, however the price did drop closer to the retail offer price during this period. Remember that this offer is public, people have the same idea as you and your shares are being diluted - so I don't believe there is significant opportunity to make money from this"	essjaybeebee	0
2020-04-07	06:27:47	I would also wait until closer to the end of the offer date before committing the funds. From Memory the funds need to be in their account by closing date so allow 2 days. The benefit of waiting is that the offer price is already locked in so you can watch the market volatility to know the discount you are receiving at the closest point in time fo receiving the shares	Azza0880	0

2020-04-04	03:40:04	Woolworth price are the same as what they were in Jun 2019, in my opinion they haven't been impacted that severely by the COVID19 crisis thus far. People are seeing them as a defensive stock hence why they haven't plunged. But with any economic crisis and rise in unemployment rate, discretionary spending inevitably declines, this is where WOW's bottom line will begin to hurt.	introvertasaurus	0
2020-04-05	20:42:42	I think it's picking up pennies in front of the steamroller to buy even defensive stocks like WOW at this point. All the expensive goods where they make higher margins will be left on the shelf and logistical/supply problems are likely to hit their cost budget too. Tons more staff on a casual wage loads on top. And then, as some have pointed out, there's going to be the great winnowing of expenditure by millions of people once their spare bedroom is full of toilet paper. People on the dole don't spend $300/week on groceries. I'm long on a couple of high cashflow gold producers (EVN WAF) but I'm shorting everything else.	hidflect1	0

2020-04-02	15:27:17	"Banks are very complicated. Disclosure currently holding all big 4 except for WBC (due to the unpredictable factor of the AUSTRAC fine, I know it's priced in to a degree and things always have some degree of unpredictability, especially in these circumstances, but I like to avoid it where possible).

&#x200B;

Good news: all bank P/E are very low and have strong balance sheets, meaning that if a recovery does happen, banks will doubtless rise. 

&#x200B;

Bad news: No-one knows if and when a recovery will happen, and banks are suffering in the short term from (among other things) low interest rates and a lack of debtors' ability to repay their loans. 

&#x200B;

As for differentiating the banks: CBA and WBC are more real-estate and consumer focused in their lending, ANZ and NAB are more business-focused. Make your own judgement as to which you think has better prospects in the coming times. WBC and NAB got hit hardest in recent times by non-corona factors (NAB with the royal commission, WBC with the money laundering scandal). CBA has generally been the safest and best performing bank, but also the most overvalued (my opinion, don't take as advice). NAB and WBC have taken bigger recent hits before corona, and thus represent the most ""on-sale"" price. ANZ something of a middle ground. If you are confident in the big four recovering through the adversity, WBC and NAB probably your biggest potential to rise (possibly choose between these based on your opinion of whether consumer or business banking has a stronger outlook). ANZ and CBA are less attractively valued in terms of their on-paper business, but safer in terms of their recent performance.

CBA for exposure to residential.
NAB for exposure to small businesses and residential.

2020-04-02	23:42:53	I've always thought it was overall a good company, well diversified and good performance, plus low P/E. However my understanding is that it's largely an investment bank, and so while the other big players aren't exactly cheering in the current situation, Macquarie's been hit especially hard. I'm not holding them but they could really surge if circumstances turn around. If not, though, they could have some way to fall (could be true of anything, but especially of an investment-based business). I'm not about taking that risk, personally.	Acetrainer333	0

Due to social distancing and self isolation being so effective, our society has effectively zero herd immunity nor does it have a working vaccine.

So as soon as businesses reopen that curve goes exponential again.

Even if we get to zero new cases in 4 or 8 weeks, it'll only take one person to kick it all off again (due to lack of herd immunity) and everything has to shut down again.

So the government has a choice, either keep businesses shut and wait for a vaccine or deliberately choose for people to die to start the economy back up (aka build up herd immunity).

I don't know how long we will be in lock down for. I don't think enough people understand that you can't just pay everyone who isn't working and expect the market to be fine.  

The virus itself doesn't necessarily have to be extremely fatal or cause every hospital across the nation to be filled to have a negative effect on the market, it just has to slow down/stop productivity.  

The loss of jobs has become an inevitable outcome of the virus and I'm glad that Australians will be financially supported during these tough times.  I don't think that will prevent the market from dropping though.

I work full time in medical so wouldn’t have time to undertake the fundamental analysis, and I like the concept that the only thing that matters is the share price, not the companies fundamentals of which there are too many variables to keep track of. You could argue the same about TA I know, but I feel there is less bias involved in TA than FA. 

In regards to why does someone have to sell their strategy if it’s ‘that good’ - for money. The technical analysis is now fully automated so it takes no time and trading is done based on closing data, so why not spend the rest of your day marketing it for more money. 

Not 100% sold on paying for the subscription - but I do like the educational side of what Nick offers.

2020-04-02	19:12:38	"Exactly, I feel techincal analysis and in particular momentum trading has much less bias than FA.

People with jobs will reduce discretionary spending. Large household name companies will go under. Retail will be hit hard - sorry AfterPay investors :(. Maybe people will have to sell their negative equity properties. It won't be fun.

Now; the timeline of these events come into question - can I stomach holding BBOZ for this long ? (aka: can the market remain irrational longer then I can solvent ? (>!they can!!<)). I'm not sure, maybe in a few days I'll reduce my position and accept a loss on the parcels I bought a few weeks ago (I guess that is the stop loss you mention), which are currently offset by gains from the very early parcels I bought.

Who knows, maybe one day you can sit around a camp fire telling young investlings of how this noob investor lost some cash and didn't DCA into the best recovery of all time. And for the record - I'm happy if you dance."	maximiseYourChill	0

The fight here is between people who invest on emotions and people who invest on statistics. Long term, statistics will always win. Short term, emotions usually win (or lose - in any event, will have greater gains or losses).  

What is 'long term' and what is 'short term' - well, an interesting question. 

Its fine to be one or the other or both in part.  Speculate/trade and also invest. Doesnt have to be all one or all the other. 

And emotions are important - if you are stressed about the market then not investing may be the best thing for you emotionally; the thought of perhaps losing some gains that will show up in 10 years doesnt pay for the cost of your stress today. 

And lets not forget, BBOZ and BBUS can be legitimate hedging techniques."	Karmaflaj	0

This also usually occurs after the shine of government intervention has worn off and companies start to release their guidance's. We're also yet to see the super funds sell off their equity holdings to raise cash for members withdrawing their super, and the firms are already raising concerns about how ill prepared they are for this. So essentially in the short term there is no bad news, but I do believe that the bottom of the market will be tested at least once and it won't be a perfect V shaped recovery. It never has been.	24JJ42	0

I’m in the same boat. Have been paper trading for a while and decided to jump in with my $4k investment fund. After fees, I’m about 12% up over the last few weeks based on a trade every 2-3 days  and only stuck with $1k invested in a stock that’s down 14%. That one is eating at me. But in reality it’s $140 - an average Friday pub dinner and night out. 

I think this is a good time to get into investing, because the market is a bit more settled, and the big random changes have eased off, so I think companies are more or less trading on fundamentals, at a deflated price. But there is still enough gross volatility to learn the lessons you normally would have to spend months in the market to experience.

If you want to invest to learn about the stockmarket, and financial management as a life skill, then its probably a really good idea.

The chances of you making an amount of money that would be significant to you are slim, as trading fees will eat up a good portion, I'd recommend SelfWealth for the few free trades you get upon opening an account, that'll help.

If your looking at what is best strictly from a financial point of view, I would just stick it in a savings account with a 2% or higher interest rate (some quick google-fu will help you find some) and watch your nest egg grow with regular deposits. The benefit of having an emergency fund cannot be overstated, its MUCH easier to pull some cash out of your savings to pay for a surprise ambulance bill than it is to sell stock at a potential loss then wait for the transfer out.

TLDR: Save up for a bigger initial investment after first accumulating an emergency fund if your doing this to be smart with money. Throw it into the market if your looking to have some fun and gain some experience in how you can react in a volatile market."	Jesse_Welshy	0

2020-03-31	17:25:16	How much stuff did you learn before you felt confident to start trading?	Jaypee_	1
2020-03-31	20:35:33	"I took about a month, reading up on what platforms were best to use and why, understanding some commonly used terms by googling them (ex-dividend date, PE ratio etc).

Honestly most of the learning comes from doing and experience. You'll slowly (or quickly if you're lucky) work out what strategy works for you.

For example, I spent a lot of time reading financial reports to understand what qualities in a company I liked (healthy gross margin, limited debt or at least healthy debt coverage with cash and receivables, steady revenue growth), and that'll differ from investor to investor (some people don't like companies who hold cash because it can appear like the company doesn't know how to invest it and it's a waste, for example).

I think a few consistent things I've been recommended and recommend to others are:

* Never invest funds that you wouldn't be okay if it hit zero (which can happen!)
* Invest in what you know and can understand. I too bought A2M as another commenter. I bought it because I could see a lot of my friends were developing lactose intolerances (which didn't seem to be much of a discussed issue a decade or two earlier), baby formula was a big thing (still is) and they didn't have a crazy amount of debt. Ticked my boxes and I went in. People were hyping Lithium miners when I started investing, and I didn't understand how valuations could work for a miner who was prospecting and didn't actually dig any minerals out of the ground yet. They went boom and now look at most of them. You don't need to have a crystal ball, but if you can understand a business and how their prospects apply to everyday life, it's not a bad way to start looking at companies. It's like, if you think the housing market is in trouble now, would you invest in [realestate.com.au](https://realestate.com.au)? No right?
* Stick to your convictions, but know when to pull the pin. Set a bottom out price that you're willing to weather on the chance you got an assumption about a company wrong, and also set an upward sell price (even if it's only taking your cost off the table). Everything in between is you riding the ups and downs of sentiment changes
* Just because something is at an all time low, doesn't mean it's cheap and a good buy. Also, just because something is at an all time high, doesn't mean it won't come down. People are looking at big blue chips at the moment because of the market downturn, everything's become ""cheap"". But little to no economic data has come out yet to back up valuations right now, so it's hard to say whether these are truly cheap or not. You might buy CBA today at $60 because it's the biggest bank and not long ago it was $90, so it should survive right? Well it goes back to point 2, if you don't know enough about the bank and how it makes money, not worth risking the money simply because it's at 52 week lows
* If you're not confident, start with Index ETFs (google the definition!). They are way safer and gives you diversity amongst companies and markets (vs investing in a single ASX company)
* Never trust stock picking advice from others. They are just as good/bad as you are, the difference is experience levels (but experience is not always a good thing). I've been told so many stock tips over the years, in businesses I don't understand, because it was what was ""hot"". Most of those have collapsed (or at least share price has) since. Use these stock tips to broaden your horizon for businesses to research and understand.

Pandos17	0
2020-03-31	23:08:36	"No worries, glad I could help. Regarding ETFs, what doesn't make sense to you? I'm no expert but I can (or at least others can) try and help if you post what your questions are.

Regarding ETFs, I would keep it as simple as possible. Low management fees, tracking an index or industry and giving you diversification (i.e. access to global markets etc). What ETF you go with or look at will depend on how narrow/wide you want those factors to be. People like Vanguard (I do too) because of it's simplicity and comparatively low fees. 

I too played the ASX game back in the day, it's great to help build an understanding of the mechanics of buying and selling shares, but my understanding (could be wrong or outdated) is that it only goes for a quarter at a time. So historically (or at least when I played), it encouraged people to take speculative small/micro cap share bets to maximise return (i.e. gambling that 1c share becomes 4c in the space of 3 months). People shouldn't be doing this in real life, so in that way it's not a perfect reflection or practice for real life share trading.

With regards to your performance in the game, that would be the whole argument regarding ""time in the market"" vs ""timing the market"". I assume you picked up a good volume of those shares in the past 2-3 weeks? In this case, you were ""lucky"" that you had capital to invest at a time when shares were getting smashed, so then you timed your entry into the market well because now markets have recovered (somewhat). That works great if you plan to invest very sporadically (i.e. each major economic downturn), so you just hold cash in between each big market drop and pick up shares on the cheap. This goes to point 4 in my earlier post. That's fine and all, but you won't be maximise your return, as you'll only get this kind of chance once or twice a decade. If you look up the ASX200 on google or another index charting website you'll see what I'm referring to, since the GFC, the ASX200's never gotten back down to that level, and in each dip since 2008, the ASX200 has never dipped back to as low as the preceding low (looking at roughly June 2012, Feb 2018 and Dec 2018). The only exception being the dip we went through a few weeks ago.

So imagine you're in those moments at those points in time, and the only thing you have is the preceding data before it.. do you buy in because it's dipped, or do you hold off because you know it's dipped previously below this and at that point in time you don't know if it will go further down? Even outside of the time frames I've listed above, you can see there's been ups and downs (volatility), I'm sure plenty of people have bought those small dips only to be burnt by larger dips now.

That ties back to points 2 and 3. I typically treat market volatility (particularly down turns) as a chance to buy a company I believe in at a discount, rather than buy a big company that happened to drop because the market did. 

Because ultimately market sentiment (especially in a big economic moment like we are in today) will likely drag almost all shares down. So you need to hold your nerve and potentially carry a share through a -20 to -25% drop (or more), because you believe in the company. Other times it's a great chance for your to re-evaluate whether what you liked in the company when you bought it originally still holds true today."	Pandos17	0
2020-04-01	00:54:39	"I apologize now if the questions sound really stupid or that I misunderstood some terms and it doesn't even make sense at all. 

1. Okay so I guess the returns through distribution confuses me. or just in general, how does my money 'grow' over the 30 years I invest in an ETF? For example, I buy $1000 in a year in IOZ, ""In the last 12 months investors were paid 3.94% pa\*""(that means per annum yeah?). Do I only get $39.4 back the whole year? this sounds so stupid, I'm absolutely sure I'm missing something. 
2. These ETFs have an Index they're trying to mirror correct? and in IOZ's case it's S&P/ASX 200. Is it S&P/ASX 200 that determines the target/benchmark performance? Is it fixed? the [benchmark return for IOZ](https://imgur.com/a/v4m9pMH) is 8.64. Is that what IOZ will be striving for indefinitely?  
3. I'm trying to use [Vanguard's Managed Fund Fee Calculator](http://insights.vanguard.com.au/ManagedFundFee/ui/index.html) is the pre-filled ""future rate of investment earnings"" basically the benchmark or return per year I mentioned in 2. ?
4. This is unrelated to ETFs but goes back to your previous comment. You mentioned you wouldn't buy stocks in real estate right now, how come? I had assumed that despite all that's going on the properties they own won't depreciate in value? and considering that Australia is quite multicultural and maybe gets a fair amount of refugees that people would be back to buying properties when this blows over.

What broker do you use for buying VAS?  

Yes the game still goes only for a quarterly span. I was mainly trying it to see how day-trading would go when stocks are volatile. But I'm assuming that day-trading may not be possible or profitable in ASX especially if I had a 9-5 job, where I can't be watching the charts the entire day, nor do I think I want to anyway.  

  
So what you're saying is if this were a normal day in AU, it would've been hard to make that much in such a short time? because the market isn't as volatile and volumes are low? but this IS a good time to be buying 'good value' stocks(those that I believe to be bouncing back up later on) since they are somewhat on a discount?"

1. So with shares, money can ""grow"" as either capital gain or dividends. Capital gains are just the share price going higher than it was when you bought it (and you realise that gain when you sell). Dividends is when a company/shares distribute money to shareholders (usually out of profit), and my understanding for ETFs is they distribute the gains they get from  the shares they hold (or if they rebalance the portfolio of shares they hold and distribute some gains there).  With dividends and yield, be careful to understand the underlying math when calculating, because there's a few yield definitions. The one listed on [ASX.com](https://ASX.com) is Dividend yield, which is typically dividends for last 12 months/share price. So using IOZ as example. the 5.88% Dividend yield is taken by taken last 12 months dividends (18.642c + 36.848c + 35.853 + 31.516c) over today's closing price $20.98 (I imagine the math is slightly off because of rounding). Returns quoted by ETF I think are combination of changes in NAV (Net asset value) and Dividends.. I don't know the exact math but I guess it would be the NAV change from 2 points in time + dividends over that period. So your return would not just be % x your initial outlay.
2. Most are benchmarked against an index, but the source of the index can vary (and some will just say they are following closely but trying to beat X index).  Depending on what the ETF is trying to do, most tend to claim to match an index performance, where as ""actively managed"" implies they are trying to beat an index (and they will charge more fees for that) for example. They might over/under achieve this if they rebalance their portfolio at different times vs the index they are matching against. Inverse ETFs also exist which try and match the opposite (i.e. ASX200 Futures goes down, the ETF value goes up), and some might have a multiplier on performance (i.e. 2x better than index movement). So buying an ETF is ""safer"" than individual shares, because 1 purchase exposes you to many companies vs just buying 1 and ETFs will rebalance periodically. i.e. If you bought a company that drops out of the ASX200, you'll weather that whole loss, where as ETF would go down slightly, and then rebalance it out of the porfolio next time.
3. Managed funds differ from ETFs as they aren't listed on the ASX. I'm honestly not too familiar, other than knowing they give you access to more options but the investment criteria is higher (i.e. minimum investment amounts etc), so I can't comment on this one.
4. Oh my comment was an example. [realestate.com.au](https://realestate.com.au) earns money from listings of property for rent or sale (is my limited understanding of their business model). If you assume property markets going down and there'll be a reduction of sales (because people will only sell at a discount to liquidate cash), then that website that earns money from more listings would not be a great company to invest in. If you believe the opposite will be true (i.e. more sales), then it'd be worth buying into a significant dip in their share price. Depends on how you view how it's money making activity will perform in the current climate (true for any company).

I use NAB,  because they are my main bank, they offered free trades as an introductory offer (back when I was getting my feet wet this was appealing, in case I was bad at it) and they have the lowest trading fees amongst the big 4 banks

I think day trading is hard even when you can focus 100% of your time in it haha. Reason being is, you'll need more skin in the game to make a decent living of it, and then subject yourself to more risk at the same time. That also couples with how much time you've spent on this vs your return, and then how consistently you think you can pick winners, so to speak. I'm a semi-active investor but I buy for the long haul, as the math on the above didn't make sense for me vs my regular job. Don't get me wrong, you could very well replicate your in game success in real life, but my anecdotal experience has been when your real money is at risk and larger volumes of it, peoples invest decisions and behaviour tend to differ.

Right now I think your downside risk is lower as the share market is at a historic low right now, but there's still plenty of risk and reasons why it could go lower, but over the long run (talking 5-10 years) you'll make a decent gain on companies (assuming they survive and can thrive in a post-pandemic world). When there's wide spread share market decline, you are more likely to be able to pick better winners who will go up if the company is solid, than say in a market at all time highs and picking which company can go even higher still. So that's a yes to your very last comment/question.

The hard part at the moment is you/we have very little economic data to know which companies are better positioned to survive and thrive in this environment. That is the inherent risk that comes with the potential opportunities discussed.

EDIT: Just to add, I think many would recommend holding off given the economic fallout of this really hasn't hit yet (going back to the lack of data right now), but no one's got a crystal ball. It may well be that the market decline last week was pricing in the worst case scenario (who knows), or it might be the tip of a very big downward spiral iceberg. It's really up to your risk tolerance and financial profile. Following recommendation 1 in my earlier post would guide you quite well I think."	Pandos17	0

2020-03-31	20:40:19	They sell share index futures (SPI 200 futures); and they do not short sell shares in the underlying index. Price movements in BBOZ are  reflective of futures prices, and not necessarily the price level of the share market index especially during times of volatility. It’s a short exposure to the share market via futures.	KilaPinguino	0

2020-04-01	17:36:10	BEAR isn't leveraged and doesn't use derivatives so it moves almost perfectly inversely to XJO with a Beta of \~ -1. The portfolio is predominantly simple ASX equity shorts, so nothing traded in foreign exchanges in different time zones. During the rest of the year BEAR isn't overly profitable, but with +/- 5% swings a day now being considered pretty normal, BEAR has become a lot more lucrative without the added risk of leveraging.	24JJ42	0

2020-04-14	01:12:01	The way in which these funds are structured are different to the American 2x ETFs. Those rebalance daily whereas these funds use a threshhold based rebalance - this means the extent of decay can be a lot less than the US products. It can still exist but its not right to google the 2x products to get a sense of the Australian products - they are structured quite differently	thembi77	0
2020-03-31	04:04:52	"Make sure you follow the S & P 500 futures. It was ticking away today even though their market is closed. Yes on Friday it was down over 3%, which looked good for BBUS. However, today it was more like down 1%, and then under 1% closer to ASX closing. Hence why it didn't get the full gains from Friday.

I don't see America doing well anytime soon. They will have over a million infected, or more."	obeymypropaganda	0

I can certainly see them growing more and more with e commerce and online usage, but they are also quite high beta so dont forget the risk.

 A major risk is if they dont get new contracts or their current ones arent renewed they will struggle quite quickly, as they are a business that relies on other businesses (B2B).

Keep in mind that even with that bounce back from $2 to $3 Qantas is still below half what it was, so if it's on sound financial footing to recover then pin pointing the bottom isn't as valuable as catching the full recovery.

I suggest you research first before buying IPO stocks. 
You can also find upcoming IPO [here](https://www.asx.com.au/prices/upcoming.htm)

The company mentioned above when it’s on the public market would be called “penny stocks” also Small Caps. Meaning Small Capitalisation.

2020-03-29	18:47:31	Trade and other payables is what they owe other companies for buying stuff off them on credit (rather than a straight cash purchase), it's counted as an outflow on the income statement even though no cash has changed hands yet	nick168	0
2020-03-29	19:33:52	"I once dated a girl who worked at Flight Centre, she told me stories about their annual Christmas trips where they would fly all the key staff around the wold and put them up in resorts which was essentially ""schoolies"" for grown ups. Her favourite one was when they flew to Mexico for a few days. They would have daily team meetings or conferences, and it was a running joke about how someone was already drunk, someone didn't turn up because they were still drunk or who was able to source whatever drugs they wanted. This was all lead by, and encouraged by executives and she took great delight in telling me all the stories.

Anyway, that was years ago and at the point in time I decided I didn't want anything to do with that company, yes it was only anecdotal and focussed on a small aspect of the company, but that kind of behaviour just seemed overtly risky and brazen."	introvertasaurus	0

2020-03-29	19:59:51	Anyone one thinking about investing in FLT needs their head read. It’s a miracle it’s survived until now. Ask yourself how many millennial do you know that use it? It would have died a natural death sooner or later anyway. The company has no future.	j03l5k1	0
2020-03-29	22:08:38	Probably rents for their stores. High traffic areas in malls and on the High Street. I think a lot of their revenue is package deals you can't source online easily like a tour down the Rhine with the airfare and tour guide piled together. That's all gone now. You can be sure the landlords won't be budging on their leases which are probably multi-year agreements so...	hidflect1	0
2020-03-29	18:49:32	"Ah I see, any idea what that is? What would flight centre need to buy on credit? And wouldn't that mean flight centre is going to be in trouble, their current liabilities exceed their current assets.

2020-03-29	19:47:41	"one of the perks of working for that company, you get to file all expenses (vacations, alcohol) into 'other payables'.

It's a temporary halt, they say there's going to be an announcement soon. I believe... they said it shouldn't take more than 7 days or so, but... I could be wrong."	ProfessionalAddress5	0
2020-03-30	05:40:34	"Good insight. Yeah... I suppose a lot of it goes into receivables and contract assets. 

Scary times for travel agents... but is there really a chance these guys are going to go bankrupt?"	ProfessionalAddress5	0
2020-03-30	17:01:33	"I believe you, they're a monster of a company during decent operating conditions. 

But, I'm going to play devil's advocate here. This is during a global pandemic. The risks are... if this COVID-19 lasts longer than previously thought and if it returns with a second potentially more deadlier wave. It's entirely possible for these difficult operating conditions persist for a year or so. I think that's the fear.

 And investors may be worried air travel will change forever? Although, that's probably unlikely, as air travel seems to have only gotten better since 9/11. 

That said, it's also possible this COVID-19 gets completely cleared up in a couple of months. I'm just trying to figure out whether FLT and other travel agencies can survive the worst case scenarios and rebound."	ProfessionalAddress5	0
2020-03-31	02:42:45	"> Hello, I used to work in Flight Centre. As I am unable to buy their stock, I have bought their competitor Hello World. 

Any reason why you're forbidden from buying their stock? Is it simply as you're an ex-employee?"	mikewilliamz	0
2020-03-29	20:22:13	Depends if they were in the process of going completely online like webjet. This could expedite that transition and help long term. I don't know enough about their long term strategy to say either way tho	mpg1846	0
2020-03-29	21:33:45	">  Ask yourself how many millennial do you know that use it? 

Honestly, I don't use it and I don't really know anyone else who uses it. But I don't travel much. 

For simple one-way trips using travel agents is probably a waste of money. But, there's still a surprising amount of people who don't know how to book flights, hotels, etc online. I don't doubt there's plenty of people who want their hand held or want someone else to do all the admin/logistics for them. 

It's kind of like real estate agents, a lot of people use them, even though it's debatable how much value they provide."	ProfessionalAddress5	0
2020-03-30	04:53:05	"As the people get richer, the more they have to spend on luxuries such as holidaying without worrying about the couple of hundred bucks on booking from dodgy websites.

Problem for flight centre is people aren't getting richer and we're going into a minimum one year travel ban."	Embiidious	0
2020-03-31	02:49:43	"I have thought this too, along with other travel agencies (seems like flight centre and universal flights are the head honchos in Australia though).

I know know one person in the younger age bracket that has booked any sort of holiday with them. All of their other clients seem to be in the 55+ bracket. 

I can see how travel agencies could be utilized pre-internet days, but in 2020 they offer zero value.

I know there's another comment in this thread about Flight Centre being an Australian staple and having cash reserve, but just based on how their business model seems outdated, I think their operations will be limited moving forward."	mikewilliamz	0
2020-03-29	23:52:49	"Yeah, I doubt the landlords will want to give them anything, but this COVID-19 situation, they may be able to delay payments or something? 

I find it hilarious how they keep mentioning they have >$1b cash or something. Which is true... but they don't mention the part where they also have that much payables."	ProfessionalAddress5	0
2020-03-29	19:08:43	"When you are running a business, its insanely inefficient to constantly be paying your suppliers everytime you make a purchase.  
So business' will make credit arrangements with each other, in order to cut down the administrative effort, credit terms will be set (usually to 30, 60 or 90 days) and then finance departments will only pay these when required."	FWB4	0
2020-03-29	18:54:10	"> What would flight centre need to buy on credit?

I have no idea to be honest, they might mention it in the appendix but it's worth mentioning that these are only 30, 60 or 90 day credit purchases that are (usually) interest free rather than long term loans

> And wouldn't that mean flight centre is going to be in trouble, their current liabilities exceed their current assets.

I'd focus on the cash flow statement rather than the balance sheet to see if a company is in trouble"	nick168	0

2020-03-29	19:38:23	Thats not information you're likely to find. If I had to take an educated guess, it'd be heavily weighted towards corporate travel clients.	FWB4	0

2020-03-29	19:52:00	"Hmm, ok, thanks. 

I can see from their AR, they break the 'trade and other payables' into figures approximately:

* Trade payables - $485m
* Client creditors - $972m
* Accrued unsecured note interest - $3m
* Annual leave - $46m
* Straight-line lease & lease incentive ability - $10m

Still, the trade payables and client creditors section is not very transparent. 

I know according to some accounting standard, they refer to their travel suppliers as customers/clients."	ProfessionalAddress5	0
2020-03-29	21:15:28	I just think that's a bit of a low barrier for avoiding a company. Drinking culture in companies is widespread, especially ones built on sales.	General_Pie	0

I know this is the internet but maybe don't treat every conversation like a personal challenge? Your response could maybe have been an elaboration on why you think that behaviour is brazen or risky, or why that is different to other companies. But no, just ""I don't care if you agree"".

2020-03-28	15:35:42	Most of the expectations and all of the facts that have occurred to drive the AUD down to date have been built in to the price already. In fact, it's fallen way too much because there's no real way to value how much a currency should move based on single events. But big moves make traders big money and they drive the market. So you will see in periods of relative quiet, the AUD drift back up and all the reasoning like US printing, etc. is just suppositioning to justify the need to reset the AUD back up again before it gets taken down again. It's a market not a science.	hidflect1	0

This down turn will be more widespread, but if history is any guide and it often is, it probably is a decent long term buying opportunity. Down from near mid 30s.

2020-03-29	20:02:46	"During a depression the economy has too much of a debt burden thus the economy goes through a deleveraging process. So since CCP is a debt collecting company it’s business should naturally go down right? Unemployment rates are going up so not many people are going to borrow more money.

2020-03-28	17:55:14	"Australia has 2 Fridays and one Monday. What I mean is, in pessimistic times, the ASX will sell down on its Friday close in a risk off maneuver not wanting to hold over the weekend, then the US will do the same with their Friday leaving the ASX to face the storm opening first on a Monday with only the red of the US equities from Friday as the indicator. 

More generally, the basic problem with the ASX is it's gutless and follows the Dow's lead almost pedantically. Trouble is, while the Dow might be bouncing because they got a $5Trillion boost, the ASX got no such thing. So, on the morning after a US bounce, you'll find the ASX also jumps on open only to slide down through the rest of the day as people take profits/risk off. The last few weeks that's been a consistent money maker for me. Wait for the spike on open and immediately short the big boys."	hidflect1	0

The reality is this is the sharpest downfall in history, and that nobody living today has dealt with a recession in this nature before.

The reality is the majority of those blindly stating 'this is a dead cat bounce' have never traded during a sharp bear market before. Those who confidentially claim this are evidently new to trading and will miss out on the most significant gains from markets reversing.

People buying things because ""they're cheap"" is an example of current sentiment. Its the start of a brand new bear market so people are still bullish about stocks. If it slowly bleeds for a year, watch how many people will want to Buy the dip and get cheap stocks.

2020-03-29	18:53:52	I recently tried to buy APT puts on commsec and got some weird errors saying that trade wasn't allowed or doesn't comply with something. I wonder what's going on?	ProfessionalAddress5	0

How BNPL performs in a recession is a big unknown (but we do know retail is way down) and APT has yet to turn a profit; even before the virus. The US is its biggest market and it looks like they will be hit hardest of any country. 

That plus everything else risky about this new BNPL industry.

I do actually believe in BNPL but the current price is too high given all this fallout from the virus. I reckon wait and see if it falls back down."	josh__ab	0

2020-03-27	12:31:34	"You have not accounted for quantitative easing, which is known to inflate equity/asset prices. They did not do quantitative easing in 1929.

There have been articles researching the effect of quantitative easing on the stock market - which shows a very strong R\^2 = 0.8623 correlation between amount of QE and increase in stock market index; every $1billion in QE correlates to a 0.48 increase in the S&P index.

Thus a $2 TRILLION QE in the linear model is supposed to increase the S&P index by 1000!

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4305359-qe-and-stock-market](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4305359-qe-and-stock-market)

So in the short term I think OP is screwed - unless the economy really does a Great Depression. In any case, if the economy is screwed, the QE is likely to cause stagflation - where the economy shrinks, and asset/equity prices increase.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - quantitative easing is bad for those in inverse ETFs as printing money props up stock and other equity/asset prices (who'd a thunk eh? Makes obvious sense when you think about it). That's why you DYOR. It is in this case not that the market is irrational; it is because it IS rational regarding QE that prices went up."	witchdoc86	0

2020-03-26	21:13:13	"You are right.

Maybe think of it this way. With an unhedged fund you buy shares in USD (or whatever currency it is) and you convert it back to AUD *at the time of sale.*  

With a hedged fund you buy shares in USD but you then convert it back to AUD *at the time of purchase.* 

so assume:

* at time of purchase USD1 = .50 AUD
* You buy shares worth $2000 USD ( cost = AUD4000)
* You sell shares worth $4000 in 2 years. At that stage 1USD = 1AUD

**unhedged**: at time of sale you get USD4000, convert at time of sale = AUD4000. 

**hedged**: at time of sale you get USD4000 but you convert it as at the date of purchase ie convert it at AUD.50. So you get AUD8,000.

The reverse, of course, also applies. 

The downside of hedging is that you are expecting an increase in AUD, and the AUD will increase if Australia is 'doing better' than the US. So you are buying US shares, but part of your return is in fact how well Australia is doing. That is a loss of diversification, but some argue potentially a reduced risk (because your return is linked only to market return, not market return plus exchange rates)."	Karmaflaj	0
2020-03-26	20:59:35	"If you think the AUD is going to get weaker eg. move from 59c (currently) -> 50c per 1 USD then you would be better off buying IVV.

If you think the AUD is heading toward parity with the USD eg. 1 USD to 1 AUD then you would be better off buying IHVV"	MrFabulousSrs	0

>hedged: at time of sale you get USD4000 but you convert it as at the date of purchase ie convert it at AUD.50. So you get AUD8,000.

I might be wrong but I was informed that hedging etfs use rolling forward contacts that eliminate currency movement. So in this situation where you invest AUD$4000 at 1USD = 0.5AUD and realise at 1USD = 1AUD:

Unhedged: Your investment is halved as you're open to currency fluctuations so your return is AUD$2,000

Hedged: Your investment stays the same as hedging eliminates currency fluctuations so your return is AUD$4,000.

As far as I know hedging eliminates currency movement so you won't lose or make money due to a change in exchange rate. You will only lose or make money *in comparison* to an unhedged equivalent."	Scott_003	0
2020-03-30	22:03:51	"yes in terms of 'high' and 'low'. Whether 75c is that point is up to you! 

Essentially, if you think that when you sell the AUD will be lower vs USD than it is when you buy, then you dont hedge. If you think it will be higher at time of sale, then you hedge. Of course this is picking the market, so all the usual caveats. 

If you are investing for the long term (say 5 or 7+ years) I think most people will say that there is really no ability to predict that far into the future.

If you have both an AUD portfolio (ie AUS shares) and foreign currency (FX) shares, then in theory not hedging reduces total volatility. As Australia does 'badly' and the AUD falls, the value of your AUS shares probably falls as well (because the country is not doing as well). However, the AUD value of your FX shares increase due to the decreased dollar. So overall you offset local losses with overseas gains (and vice versa). 

This is, in part, why most portfolio suggestions include a heavier weighting to AUS shares than its proportion of the world market eg maybe 40/60 AUD to FX. Since you need to spend AUD, its really the AUD value of your investments that is relevant (USD100 isnt much use until you convert it to AUD). 

A split portfolio provides some protection against Australia doing badly, or against the rest of the world doing badly\*

You can, of course, get the same result by having a 100% FX share portfolio, but hedging part of it

\*as with pretty much any mechanism that reduces risk, it also reduces return. If you were fully invested overseas and not hedged, and the AUD drops, you get extra return (share value plus currency). If the AUD goes up, you lose some of those returns. A mixed portfolio will return less when the AUD is dropping significantly, and will lose less when the AUD rises significantly."	Karmaflaj	0

2020-03-26	19:16:21	I think travel levels might actually spike once this is over as a lot of people who have had to put trips and vacations on hold will want to make up for that and airlines will probably be offering some good deals to entice people.	fullM3TALturban	0

Although Australians will have less money, and less buying power (low AUD), some destinations will be cutting prices to make it attractive too, as well as airlines like you said.

Also I doubt Covid19 will just be over one day.  It will be a gradual process of people realising it is safe to travel.  But I can imagine a lot of people will be less willing to travel if they are not immune (depends on exposure + vaccine etc).  Think about it, if you were 65 would you travel to Indo or Thailand knowing it is still out there albeit at lower levels ?

I think the reality is there won't be further travel bans, only extensions of the current bans. 

The travel that's currently permitted isn't going to significantly contribute towards transmission of this disease, but there is certainly risk for a further decline to airline prices if they announce closed state and international borders for a few months (or even 6 months), rather than what imo is currently looking like one month or so."

2020-03-27	00:25:06	"Because the US isn't even doing a proper lockdown nationally yet, they're about to hit 100k in cases in 2 days, and they're nowhere near their peak. 

We are barely into this pandemic and the markets have no reason to rise with so much uncertainty in play. The markets went up from 6 trillion being pumped into the US economy to try and keep it going, once people realise that money doesn't magically fix a pandemic and they have to do a national style lockdown to slow the spread the markets will tank even further. 

US unemployment gets released tonight at 11:30pm AEST, if it's over 3.5 million markets will be in for a bad time, and remember the US only had 1k total cases on March 11. They're now rapidly approaching 100k by Sunday. The media will latch onto the death rate and the overrun hospitals, spreading further fear within the community hurting the markets even more. They will hit 1k deaths per day very, very soon.

NZ is in stage 4 national lockdown at 200 cases, Australia is about to hit 3k cases and we can't even get a clear direction from our government. These half measures have already cost 100s of thousands their jobs, with more industries about to fall when we have to enact even stricter lockdowns in the next 1 - 2 weeks to try and stop the spread."

You can buy XJO which is the ASX200 index. The value of this index is equal to the sum of 1 share in every ASX 200 company.

With $2,000 dollars, diversifying is not really an option with such a small amount. Perhaps consider splitting it into 2x $1,000 lots and pick big name companies like QANTAS and JHHIFI that are tried and tested in the market. Not a recommendation, just something to consider."	ASXXXThrowaway	0

Since the ASX 200 will eventually bounce back in a year or so when we've run through the recession, you could just keep buying the XJO. You might make 100% in  3-4  years if you're lucky.

With $2,000 you might as well pick two large-cap stocksand not a mix of large cap + blue-chip, which is what the XJO (ASX200) is. The return will be signficantly greater.

2020-03-25	11:59:10	" OOO is designed to track the oil price. Its a synthetic meaning it doesn't own any oil but holds derivative contracts on the price of oil. Its alao currency hedged which is actually bad if the AUD spikes up. But also good if it falls further. If oil diubles back to 40 in 2 years OOO should double up less the fees, less the hedging costs etc.

WPL has operational risk, employee benefits and safety to think about, projects that make money if oil is over $38, projects that lose money. I don't know how much cash and debt they have but you can expect cash to decline and debt to increase if tgrir funding allows for that. Debt will be more expensive also. 

Importantly you'll need to research both. OOO is easier to work out with less moving parts."	arctic_win	0
2020-03-25	15:01:42	"I think it depends on the oil price and how much it exceeds the cost of production. OOO should follow the POO , pretty straight forward, but once the price of oil/gas exceeds production costs its better for WPL or any producer I would say.

2020-03-25	14:28:40	"I'm jump on the ""work from home will be more common"" bandwagon. As unemployment stays high we might actually see stuff like the NBN getting rebuilt properly.

We'll have fewer ""I don't do technology"" types because most people will have had to acquaint themselves with stuff like Amazon, etc. to get anything. At the very least, streaming services will catch on in a bigger way.

We'll all get more comfortable with stuff like video calling as a regular form of catch-ups. 

Just about every company that scales back during this period will learn to do more with less (i.e. staff), when the recovery hits they won't be hiring additional people. I think we'll see airlines move the way they did after 9/11: somehow even smaller seats and more sparse amenities on planes.

I wonder if hospitality will come back in the same way if people get used to entertaining for themselves. I felt like in the states after the GFC it was way more commonplace for people to make their own fun at home whereas here it was a big ""out for drinks"" and foodie culture. I could also equally see people wanting to go out *more* after being cooped up for a while.

Lastly, if the real estate market tanks I think we'll see people with amassed wealth and/or secure jobs come in and scoop up bargains while the regular punters are busy rebuilding their deposits after long periods of unemployment.

Realistically, though, I think most of the economics will play out until 2025."	theresnorevolution	0

The Strauss–Howe generational theory, also known as the Fourth Turning theory or simply the Fourth Turning, which was created by authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, describes a theorized recurring generation cycle in American history. According to the theory, historical events are associated with recurring generational personas (archetypes). Each generational persona unleashes a new era (called a turning) lasting around 20–22 years, in which a new social, political, and economic climate exists. They are part of a larger cyclical ""saeculum"" (a long human life, which usually spans between 80 and 90 years, although some saecula have lasted longer).

2020-03-24	02:33:47	Does'nt 10 years seem too long to recover what someone lost in one month. This mrans there is no way i can recover my losses withing 2 to 4 years time without manipulatuon of stocks and carefully balancing my portfolio. I understood that if i pull out of the market i am locking in my losses so advise i took was not to pull out but stay in. Staying in means say if a stock x went from 10 to 3, it will take 10 years for this stock to get back to either 10 or even 7. Most of the stocks have been struck this bad if i am not exacerbating. Shouldnt i be then pulling out and saving whats left and investing in a different portfolio which has better chances of coming out on the other end quickly?	WBARI	0
2020-03-24	00:35:14	Not every share has dividends so there is no point in excluding them. Not only that but dividends shouldn't be counted towards whole market gains or even individual share price gains as they are not the same thing.	sbnas	0

Never panic buy, only buy if you can find the trend, try to see what happens on other days it's opened high and see if it stays, rises, or drops.

I was holding and sold out at 19.650. 

There's 2 ways to go about this, either hold, wait for it to go up again, which may be tomorrow, or it could be in 10 days. 

Or you can sell, wait for it to go red, then buy back in, and try re-sell when it's green again.

T+2 means money will be credited or debited on thay day.

You own shares right away and can sell 2mins later if you want.

There is a concept called contra where you buy on monday, sell on tuesday and the remaining balance will be credited or debited on Wednesday. Video explains it better."	ASXXXThrowaway	0
2020-03-22	18:30:47	No, you own the stock as soon as the order goes through. The reason for the settlement been T+2 is simply so you know how much needs to be in your account by the day which they will take out for the shares. Options is T+1, so just remember to make sure to have the funds in your account. If you buy a stock monday morning then sell monday afternoon, commsec will just take out the loss/profit at T+2	Tacomaster33	0

2020-03-22	06:06:00	The number for the share price should not be used as a value for a stock. Look at the market cap and actually understand the value and compare it to the annual reports and your research. Think about future...oh what am I on about, you dont wanna know how to get an answer yourself. No it's an airline dont invest, travel bans wont be lifted anytime soon and may get stricter.

2020-03-22	13:14:39	"As of August last year, Virgin has had 7 years of losses. 

https://thenewdaily.com.au/finance/finance-news/2019/08/28/virgin-australia-losses/

It is currently facing the worst aviation meltdown ever. It competes with a national icon that has loads more cash, a massive frequent flyer program, more routes and is profitable. 

If you need to ask about taking a position in such a stock, you should not be taking a position in that stock. Definitely not a beginners stock.

There is no guarantee they will survive, or even turn a profit in future if they do. Their major share holders are all foreign entities, mostly airlines who are all suffering the same disastrous trading conditions. They have propped up VAH and I'm not sure they want to, or have the capacity to do so under current conditions.

The major holders may take it private to reduce costs but that's just me speculating.

The govt may step in, but if they have to make a hard nosed choice between QAN and VAH it will be QAN without any doubt."	sloppyrock	0

2020-03-22	06:07:13	"No one knows. I’d steer clear though; there is a lot of speculation that they may go bankrupt (their balance sheet hasn’t been doing too well for years) and probably not much incentive for their US arm to bail them out.

A government bailout *could* benefit them, but depending on its structure, could also dilute their shares such that they fall even further. 

There certainly is money to be made if the company survive, but if you’re wanting to invest in airlines I’d say Qantas is significantly safer bet, although the point about government bailouts diluting shares still stands. Long term though, Qantas isn’t going anywhere."	yak799	0

2020-03-22	13:31:37	"I was looking at VAHHA when it was at $35, but wimped out. You could follow it instead.

pros: it pays a guaranteed $8 dividend, and in 2024 (or more likely, 2023) it'll be settled for a guaranteed $100. If VAH goes bust, it's a senior unsecured bond so you get your money before all the equity investors do. And if you bought at $35-$50, *and* it doesn't go bust, you'll be getting the sorts of returns that an equity investor would get.

cons: while those returns are really good, you'll never improve on them. Although even then, if the bond price bounces back soon you can sell the bond for 100% return without waiting 4-5 years to get 200% return"	algernop3	0

2020-03-22	17:51:47	Virgin Group is primarily a franchisor. They sell their name to other companies to stick on their business offerings - much like Jim's Group here in Australia. Branson also turns up to give the appearance that he personally backs a new Virgin branded company, but he really doesn't, as long as they keep posting their percentage. This is why many Virgin parents are now unbranding their Virgin offerings (Alaska removed the Virgin America branding, Optus removed the Virgin Mobile Australia branding...)	Kyanar	0

2020-03-20	23:30:04	"Option: 

A) Set a market order and sell for whatever the highest bid is ($23 by the sounds of things). Eat the loss, move on. Quickest resolution.

B) Set a limit order at a point that you think it will be triggered so as to not lose as much (volume here is the issue).

C) Wait for the ETF to be liquidated and receive a payout equivalent to it's NAV (currently $29.83). The longest time till resolution.

I'd take C. That cheeky little market order is hoping to snaffle himself a nice little profit by buying some shares at a 23% discount. Don't be the guy that gives him that opportunity."	innatangle	0

2020-03-20	23:35:06	"Yes, selling at market may trade at $23 depending on your broker so I wouldn't recommend that. The NAV is around $30 so if you want to sell I'd recommend putting in a limit order around that level.
Alternatively you can hold on until it's delisted (it will keep trading until April I believe). At that point they will liquidate all the assets and you'll receive a cash payout of whats left after expenses. This might have tax implications- you'd have to check with an accountant. 
I'd recommend putting in a limit sell order around the NAV though"	SPC_55	0
2020-03-20	23:49:44	"Thank you that answers my questions perfectly. Does putting in an order like he has for 23 dollars per share reserve those funds from his trading account until someone sells to him or he removes that bid? (Im wondering what the downside is to putting in a stupidly low bid price is).
Is he basically hoping someone is desperate enough to sell for that much less or is he hoping someone doesnt realise how much under NAV it is?"	dumbetfguy	0

From the AFR:

It intends to convert three of the funds – the UBS IQ MSCI World ex Australia Ethical ETF, UBS IQ MSCI Asia APEX 50 Ethical ETF and UBS IQ MSCI Australia Ethical ETF – into unlisted managed funds and keep hold of existing investors.

Investors would need to approve the conversion of the ETFs via an election process ending on April 29, with a minimum balance of $10 million for the plan to be viable.

As a sweetener, UBS will cut investor-facing fees on the three new unlisted funds by between seven and 20 basis points."	sloppyrock	0

2020-03-21	07:52:30	I signed up to self wealth due to the cheaper fees. But given that commsec have payID ( I don't bank with them) and I can therefore get money into my account faster if required, I changed to commsec. Higher fees was worth the convenience of immediate funds if required. Self wealth takes 1-2 days minimum for funds to enter account which didn't work for me as my money was otherwise sitting in a separate offset account.	mwang67	0

2020-03-20	18:22:07	Minimum I would say is where the gains are worth it to to you. I like to graph out the profit/loss from an excel solver I made and then adjust the contracts from there. At most though I would only risk what you're willing to lose, because if qantas for some mystical reason puts out an announcement that boosts the share price, your option could become worth very little. So if you're only willing to lose $300, then I'd only risk 300 at max. If you're only willing to lose $2000 same thing, and so on	Tacomaster33	0

The next government advice to come will send the market shooting right back down again.

2020-03-20	18:58:39	"Very possible

So this is just what I’m thinking at the moment 
I think that the $90b injection into small businesses that the Aus Gov has issued, the ECB launching their program of spending $820b in gov and private bonds, US Gov looking into more stimulus measures each day will stimulate the global economy 

Maybe not much, and not for long, but it may be something to keep an eye out for 

APT I feel would be a good long term stock because once businesses are back up and running, people are likely to spend, and likely on borrowed money and instalments as history shows (unless it’s different this time round and human behaviour changes due to the virus to not spending) 

WPL I feel has hit its bottom (or close to it) and oil prices have to go back up in the long run, the lows we are seeing now are interesting 
The collapse of oil prices will most likely wipe out a lot of companies during its run. Shortage of it = Higher prices
Other than that governments have been looking into intervening. Just America alone estimates a loss of 2-2.5 million barrels per day if prices do not go back up by the end of the year. And they’ll end up having to spend even more money to bail out companies or stimulate their economy and job growth in the long run  

Again, these are just my thoughts and not advice on whether to buy or not to buy 👍🏻

So it's not a perfect negative correlation with the sp500 unfortunately.	FoxBox1988	0

But what i’m looking for are early economic indicators that normality will return at a point in the future. In China, some of that normality is already occurring, however the rest of the world has approached the coronavirus vastly differently to China, and has different resources at hand to deal with it.

If the Australian economy is shut down for 6 months, then the ramifications are going to be much more severe then anyone first anticipated and I think we’re probably going to see the ASX fall to 4000. I think the current market value is priced at a 2-3 month disruption, and if it extends any longer then we will see 4000 realised."	introvertasaurus	0

2020-03-19	07:22:33	"Sounds like you want a way to define the direction (trend) of the index empirically.

It's quite hard because empirical systems can get chopped up in sideways markets. 

It's unlikely that after this free fall is over that the market will suddenly go full reverse and steam back up.  It's probably going to chop around for a bit until companies start to show continual earnings growth.  So you could be looking at an extended sideways period as bulls and bears disagree on the market's direction.

Defining the trend could also be different because you operate on different time frames.  I might trade 10 day swing trades and you might take long term position over 2 years.  So when it's down trend for me, it may still be up for you.

Having said all that, technical analysis tools can help define the trend to some extent.  You could for example define the trend as up if the XAO value is above its 50 day moving average and down if it is below it.  You could also define it as up if the XAO makes it's highest price over the last 20 days and down if it makes a lowest low over 20 days.

Doing it that way will at least ensure the market is heading slightly in the right direction and has stopped the current free fall."	dzernumbrd	0

2020-03-19	16:24:04	">  Today is up, so that takes no skill or understanding to know, except that we are trying to follow the US futures 

Futures?  The US market has been closed for barely 4 hours after losing at least -5% for the day.  It just goes to show you that you can't predict anything.

I have noticed intra-day swings in companies have been over +/-10%.  That is a huge range during the day and these are on normally ""quiet"" companies. What hope does the average punter have if they are trying to work out if it's a good time to buy or sell?

I think computer trading is having a massive effect on prices.  There are some unimaginably complex algorithms working overtime to make money for big traders and they are having a larger than normal effect on the market.

But, the market will continue to go down in the short term as new information becomes available. Predicting anything in this market will just lead to disappointment."	3rd_in_line	0
2020-03-19	18:21:37	"So are you betting money on the outcome of the prediction?  If not, what value does making the prediction add?

IMO trying to assign reason and logic to market movements is a recipe for disappointment.  There are so many participants you can't possibly work out the sum total of their combined psychology.

It's better to react to the market rather than predict it.

It's a probability function rather than a definite answer.  It's X% chance of down, Y% chance of up.  This is a 5 sigma event and we have no historical data on which to calculate these probabilities."	dzernumbrd	0

2020-03-19	02:25:57	The reason it's gone down in my opinion at such a sharp rate today along with z1p is because klarna is entering the Australian market space and is already a major established bnpl company.

Considering global events, Z1P and APT began international expansion last year and any growth from that now will probably come to a halt. Although no one could have predicted COVID-19

With the money market liquidity drying up, if Z1P and APT can't access credit and furthermore the credit they need, they are truly done for as businesses. Lower interest should extend and ease suffering. But after today's announcement from APT ceo, the stock tanked.

The GOVT will ultimately intervene to fix the liquidity issues, but that comes at the expense of inflation and debt and that only factors in Australia, although all G20 countries operate on the same rockefeller central bank model, so the economy as a whole will be alright."	chase_hendrix	0

I do have some question in regards to practical side of options cos I did get in some calls recently through commsec. How does it work if you want to exercise it early cos there is huge liquidity problem with the Australian options market. Is it just a phone call and what are the fees in exercising it. Also do you need to actually purchase the underlying asset at the strike price or could you choose to sell on the open without putting any money down if it's in the money. Also I saw in certain places that you need to buy the underlying asset on or before the expiry date/ date you exercise it, if it's a put or the option becomes useless. Also what's the processing date if you call to exercise the option or expires in the money on the Monday would you get it same day or is there a risk its out of the money by the time they process it maybe in 2 or 3 business days.

Options prices are based on the Black Scholes model. It's important to note that the prices it calculates should be used as a guide, not absolute.

I haven't been playing Aussie options because nabtrade doesn't want me to, so have been trading US ones using Interactive Brokers. I'd say the biggest potential trap at the moment is that implied volatility is very high, if this market suddenly stabilises, then IV will drop considerably and options will decrease in value as a result.

I mean that a PUT is a contract between two parties. You are looking to buy and the sellers will set the price for the PUT. As we're in a bear market and people think the market will go down further, the premium (cost of buying) per contract will be very high. So high that you may even be negative if you're in the money by the strike date.

I mention broker because you ideally don't want to pay huge fees per transaction and minimise any gains. Commbank charge $34.95 up to $10,000 in premium. Interactive Brokers charge $0.30 per contract.

2020-03-17	18:32:07	"Alright so basically an option is a contract between two parties. In other words, you need a seller (who writes the contract) and a buyer (who buys the contract).  


1 contract represents 100 shares. Buying an option contract gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a specific price on a specific date.  


**Here is a quick example:**  
Alice thinks that $CBA stock is going to go down. As a result she wants to buy CBA puts.  
Bob thinks $CBA is doing just fine and will either stay even or go up.  
Current $CBA price is $65.  
Bob writes 5 CBA PUT contracts (representing 5\*100= 500 underlying shares). Bob picks what premium he wants for these and decides he wants $0.75 per contract. The total price to buy all 5 contracts is thus 5\*100\*$0.75=$375 AUD. Bob picks a strike price of $55. This means he thinks the price won't fall below from now until the expiry date. He also picks a strike/expiry date of 1 weeks from today, say Friday 27th March 2020.  


Alice thinks $CBA will go below $55 in 1 week so she buys these 5 contracts from Bob at a price of 5\*100\*$0.75=$375 AUD (plus any broker commissions).  


At this point of time Bob is $375 richer and Alice has the potential to make money. Now fast forward to 25th March 2020 and CBA price is $60. Alice's contracts are worth more than what she bought them for now as market is moving in way she predicted. She can sell them right now for a higher price and someone else will become the owner of the contracts going forward. Going price may be $0.85 which means she can make $0.15 per contract profit if she decides to sell.  


Fast forward to 27 March 2020. Lets say CBA price is $50, Alice's contracts are in the money and can be exercised. In other words, because this is a PUT option, she can make Bob buy CBA contracts at a price of $55 (strike price). In other words, she can buy CBA shares from market at $50 and sell to Bob at $55 netting $5 profit per share. Total profit = 5\*100\*5 = $2500 - $375 (orig premium) = $2125.  


Lets say CBA was actually $58 instead. Alice contracts are not in the money. She can still exercise them if she wanted to but this would be stupid as it would result in more of a loss. As we're at the strike date there is no more potential and the contracts would be near worthless and no one would buy them. In other words Alice loses her entire $375 premium and bob keeps it.  


Hope this made sense.  
Give me your email and I'll forward you a CommSec brochure that explains international option trading. Have a read and you should understand a lot more.  


As a general rules:

\- Don't write options (loss is potentially unlimited).

\- Stick to buying options (calls and puts)

\- Consider the premiums before buying

\- Play around with tools like this:  [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)"	PersianMG	0

The price limit is how much you're willing to pay for each contract. Its seems to be quoted in points in this case where 0.1 = 10 points = $1. This makes premium 1 contract \*100 shares per contract\*$1 = $100. Not 100% sure on this.  


You are putting a bid on the market to buy this contract if its exists. If it doesn't exist your bid stays on the market. You can see on the right hand side that the current big (other people looking to buy this exact contract) is $0.00. There is no offer (people selling the contract) and no last price (meaning no one has purchased the contract recently).   


So basically this is an unpopular contract and no one is trading it. You'll run into this problem a fair bit unfortunately. Only market with plenty of option trading (in my limited experience) is the US markets."	PersianMG	0

In terms of the defensiveness of real estate investments, the reason you may perceive property to far safer is the infrequency of pricing, autocorrelated and appraisal based valuation (the value of property is a function of it's previous value - think about when you think of property prices, you think of what it was valued at and adjust up or down from there rather than starting from scratch every time. In other words, the value is *biased*), and muted volatility (the risk looks lower because of how infrequently properties are priced, whereas REITS are valued all day, so the ups and downs are significantly reduced). 

So the natural follow up question is; Are these REITS oversold and the underlying property is still worth what it was before the drop or has the true property value decreased meaningfully? No idea."		0

It is a bit hard to figure out what rock bottom is - it looks like China's stock market has pretty much stabilised, and South Korea's is stabilising. Australia, America and other countries may not yet have stabilised and may have further to go down. 

In terms of intrinsic value, many many if not most shares are at a significant discount.

Webjet is probably 25% of its market value if things were normal.

CBA is a safe option - its total assets minus liabilities is about 1 trillion dollars, and its current share price times shares outstanding is about 1.1 trillion. So its share price currently makes its price slightly more than the money it has.

OSH, WPL, STO are oil stocks also at a good discount.

Keep in mind that the current depression may last quite long depending on how long the coronavirus persists (and well, whether it becomes endemic, which it probably will like the swine flu)."	witchdoc86	0
2020-03-17	16:09:36	The market will inevitably recover but many people (including myself) don't think we've reached the bottom yet. So the biggest risk if you choose to buy now is you panicking and selling when prices continue to go down. Long as you refrain from doing that, you should be fine.	TXR22	0

I would first make sure I have a stable job (many businesses will close or cut hours; you may need that money shortly), and then buy in gradually every month over the next year or so.

How could anyone know that, when medical professionals themselves are only able to give estimates and predictions that are constantly changing? I agree, there is absolutely going to be more volatility for the foreseeable future and OP should probably wait. But just saying 'hit it hard when the virus peaks' is hardly useful.	equinox901	0

Im not saying iknow when it will peak im not a fortune teller but we will know when it HAS peaked (obviously not immidietly, but in time when the stats are looked at) and that should be the time to start in my opinion.

2020-03-17	18:23:06	"Yes, always do your own research. As for whether we will know when the virus HAS peaked, im not so sure. Information is so convoluted. Also, remember markets are (or at least should be) forward looking-that implies they are trying to price in the future expectations. So in terms of the market bottom/peak, it does not necessarily have to coincide with the virus peak. Point is, its hard to say when it will, or HAS peaked. If everyone knew when the GFC had peaked, they'd have bought on the early stages of the rebound. Even if you bought after a 20% rebound youd have made huge gains-but not many (relatively) people did. Likewise there could be a point when people think it HAS peaked and then reverts again (bull traps, dead cat bounce all that jargon). Point is, timing the market for 99% of us is a futile effort, so its better to develop a long term strategy in line with risk profile.

 But i get your point. Holding off for now is definetely sensible advise overall."	equinox901	0

 I think despite this they're well placed to come out the other end of this crisis like they did with the gfc. I like infrastructure and annuities going forward.

* Can't they ground the majority of their planes for a while, cut shifts in half etc. Surely it's worth their employees feeling some pain collectively then for the entire company to fold?

2020-03-16	19:30:57	"I looked at the QAN 2019 report last week. Passenger revenue was about 85% of total revenue at 16B, About 12B of expenditure was Staff/Fuel/Maintenance in 4B each which can be reduced or in the case of fuel, doesn’t apply if they don’t fly. Another 4B in costs may be harder to cut, but depreciation was one component that doesn’t matter that much. Finance costs were only 185M and they had 2B in cash before any other assets are counted.

Lets say they lose 80% of revenue in 2020, I think they can survive by slashing costs, just. Anything more than that and they may need loans or a bailout. 

If they survive I think they will be in a good position vs competition. I’m not buying yet but will be keeping a close eye on them as the fallout of coronavirus becomes more clear."	ASisko	0

Virgin, based on the latest announcement, have $ 1 billion in cash and have introduced a number of cost cutting measures like Qantas as well.

You sweet summer child. An airline is a debt management business that flies routes with planes it doesn't own with fuel it hasn't paid for. This is not an 'emergency situation.' It's a global catastrophe

>Surely because this is such an unusual situation, if they do owe money - it can be put on hold for some time. I doubt their lenders want them to go under. It's worth more to pay back the borrowings over time - right?

Oh nonononono. You do not understand Capitalism. Capital must be paid. 

Their lenders are:

* Customers who have paid for flights that won't happen. They will get their money back
* Fuel suppliers who have supplied fuel the airline has already burned. They need paying now, so they can pay the refiners who they acquired the fuel from on credit in the first place.
* Aircraft leasing companies, who need money now to pay the manufacturers and their lenders.
* Aircraft manufacturers (Boeing and Airbus.) They can't really afford to offer any credit at all right now.
* Bond-holders who are flat-out screwed right now
* Private or institutional lenders (investment banks and private equity.) This lot are flat-out bastards and won't extend a day's credit.

Airlines often operate with negative capital, which they float with ticket receipts. Without seat sales, they will be in dire straits in a month.

One of the majors is going to the wall over this. We'll end up with one airline, higher prices, fewer routes, and more dodgy Asian carriers operating in Australia."	ChazR	0
2020-03-16	14:31:07	To your second point - not really. If you save one business by delaying payments, you wreck another. That's the really difficult thing about debt	jhughes3818	0
2020-03-16	05:06:24	"It's not neutered profits. It's slashed revenue. Airlines have three costs and one income. They pay for aircraft, fuel, and people in a roughly 1:1:1 ratio. Their income is from selling seats. Aircraft must still be paid for. Fuel already burned must be paid for (and that's usually 90 days credit.) People can and will be laid off, but that won't staunch the bleeding. 

One of the majors will collapse, and the government will pay the other to take them over."	ChazR	0

Add to this the fact that the situation is evolving every day. In the last day we have had QAN announce flight reductions and the federal gov announce special support for airlines.

Consider that I have to weigh the decision to buy QAN against the option of buying something else. If I bought QAN now it would be gambling, not value investing. I’m more interested in the latter and there are other things I can buy right now where I can be much more confident about the impact of the current situation.

To sumarise, I am looking for value, and you can’t do that by just looking at the price of a stock. At this stage price targets are meaningless because we have a sub par level of information about the impact of the virus on the business."	ASisko	0

2020-03-15	15:28:07	"As others have said, you are better off investing in low cost ETFs (Vanguards have some of, if not the lowest fees in the asx) that track an index, if your perception is that the markets are low right now and you are “buying the dip”.

Putting your money behind a single company without much research is risky because you are subjecting yourself to their unique risks (ie regulatory risk, natural disasters, supply chain disruption, poor management, legal issues). That’s why it’s important to do your own research, because you’ll be able to make informed decisions. If you buy into big companies and they bounce back, sure you get a profit, but you’ll have little understanding as to why. Which is fine making some money in the upswing after a big dip, but in the past few years I can only think of this instance, end of 2018 and start of 2016 which had quite wide spread sell offs. If you’re happy to sit out until every 2-3 years than it’s fine, but i can’t imagine you’ll make a lot unless you put down a lot in those moments and take out a lot after.

If you’re just starting out my advice is:
* Never invest money that if it went to zero you’d be in trouble

* Invest larger chunks of cash into ETFs that track indices. This can give you exposure to overseas markets as well (ie VTS is a vanguard ETF that tracks total US market). In the same way that you’ve correctly identified spreading to different companies may mitigate risks, spreading to overseas ETFs should in theory do the same, unless it’s a global issue

* invest in more specific ETFs. For example black rock and beta shares do specialised ones that track industries such as health care or tech. If you like certain industries for macro issues (ie Health care for an ageing population), that might be an option. Management fees are higher than Vanguards though.

* Invest smaller amounts of money into individual shares that you researched. I like to focus on mid/small caps and let the index funds cover me for larger companies. Put smaller packets of money for now whilst you find your feet."	Pandos17	0

2020-03-13	23:06:56	"You don't really sell a short position to close it out. A short is effectively borrowing stock from someone and selling it when you Open the position (Borrow and sell high) in the hope that the price will be lower when it's time to close the position where you must buy the same Qty of shares in the market and give them back to the original holder. The short seller is betting on a decline.

To close out the position, early or at a pre-defined time, the Short Caller has to Buy stock. Short sellers likely timed their positions to close today before the weekend. This high number of positions closing at once creates a surge in demand and the price begins rising, it can have a runaway effect when Short sellers see the price going back up they all want to close out immediately, further creating demand and a frenzied price increase...

These are all short trades that effect share price volatility in the short term (hours / days), but the continued trend of investors dumping their stock when there is a bear market continues and the longer term trend (weeks) might be a decline.

People always buy food.

They make a profit.

But I asked myself the other day - what do each of them have that the others don’t? Not a lot really.

Shopped at Aldi the other day (Unlisted), and their products were fresher, Australian made (mostly) and we bought five meals worth for under $80, plus snacks. They even had biodegradable punnets for their produce.

So my preference would be to hold a small hand full of Coles and Woolworths and not go all in on either really. Because their only competitive advantages are scale, extortion of suppliers and market share.

Their dividends aren’t even that huge either. There’s better things you can buy right now
IMHO. I just bought NAB at $15.6, I’m looking at an entry point for AGL, BHP and a few others.

Also, just because they are all out of TP and non perishables doesn’t mean they are making a profit on it. Their supply chain and staff right back to the TP factory is running on overtime at the moment. And that costs money.

What I will say is that MOST people think the market has further to fall. Potentially a lot further. There are numerous bad things happening all at once and this is uncharted territory. Oil price collapse, deadly pandemic that is only just getting started, upcoming recession that we were heading towards even before this virus was established."	Legatus_Brutus	0
2020-03-14	16:18:50	"DYOR but I have had similar thoughts recently.

There's never any guarantees in share trading, and honestly it could still go down (60's are not a historic low for CBA, and even then it could go lower than that theoretically).

I personally am not going in because:  
1) I think the regulatory stuff that's not in the news headlines now are not going away anytime sooner. I honestly think it's probably the tip of the iceberg in terms of banks behaving badly.

2) The rise of purely online banks. I've seen it rise overseas and it's just starting to happen in Australia. ING is a good example of something inbetween the traditional banks and the online banks. So I think the Big 4 market is ripe for disruption, and I'm sure coupling in with point 1, regulatory and government bodies will not be as protective of that monopoly in the future.

The other question I'd ask yourself before choosing to go in is:

There may be a chance of profit on CBA simply because it's the biggest bank and they will recover, but can your investment dollars be better put elsewhere for a better return whilst you wait? Assuming CBA goes back to it's all time high, that's ""only"" about a +55% capital gain (and you don't know over how long that would take) not including dividends.  Solid, but most likely underindexing vs a company you picked due to solid business fundamentals and growth prospects that was oversold as the whole market crashed.

Good luck either way! Going to be an interesting few weeks/months ahead to say the least."	Pandos17	0

2020-03-13	16:53:55	"Get good at long trading first.  Shorting opportunities will always exist.

From my back testing I found short trading on share/stock markets is significantly more difficult than short trading on commodities and forex.

Everyone is working against short positions in the share/stock market.  CEOs/CIOs/CTOs/marketing/engineers/etc are all trying to grow companies and drive up valuations every single day, governments are always stimulating the economy and superannuation inflows from Australian employees are constantly adding buying pressure to shares every day.

There is a constant push by business, government and investors that make shares have an inherent long bias, this makes any short trading you do a short term proposition (i.e., 1-5 day holding period).  

This is not the case in commodities and forex where you can capture large persistent trends.

I think if you're going to trade short then using *low* leverage forex on a daily or weekly timeframe would be a safer place to learn.

There are demo forex accounts you can practice with fake money (oanda has them for example)."	dzernumbrd	0

2020-03-12	18:58:08	"That all depends on whether their major  holders in Etihad, Singapore Air, Nanshan Holdings, HNA group and the Virgin group decide to keep tipping in cash. 

Singapore and Etihad are Qantas' and Emirate's competitors. Different airline alliance too.

If they let VAH go, they will be shoveling money hand over fist to Qantas and their alliance partners. Imagine Qantas' fares without competition. 

Letting high value on-carriage passengers fly with Qantas domestically may see them join Qantas with their very strong loyalty program. Then possibly lose them internationally.

I suppose it depends on how VAH's backers want to lose money. Let it go, or, keep it afloat to keep their customers away from Qantas.

If VAH were on their own they'd be gone, I'm sure."	sloppyrock	0

In a market with such a volume of business travel for government departments. They’ve been reaping the public service (lowest price wins) for millions each year solely for flights to Canberra.

I’ve seen government prices during parliamentary sitting week, we are talking $500-800 one way from major cities during the peak period - paying the ‘government business’ tax. And they pay it too!!

Also, policy bans the use of Tiger flights due to the frequency of their cancellations.

2020-03-12	22:11:49	Tiger are of course owned by VA these days.. but I could see VA abandoning the Tiger brand and moving the entire VA brand back downmarket in an effort to survive.  I am not sure they will be around in their current form longer than 12 months though - HNA are nearly bankrupt and since Etihad have had a change in management they are not so keen to keep tipping billions down the drain into failing airlines.  They’ve already walked away from Air Berlin, Jet and Alitalia.  My prediction is that AirNZ may reenter the Australian market since theyre exempt from the 50% Australian ownership rule anyway and won’t need to mess around with the complicated ownership structure that VA have.  Whether they do that under their own brand or takeover the VA brand I don’t know...  but I hope it would work out better than it did with Ansett.	enobar	0

Not really a bear market hedge

Works to some degree, though with global yields so low already, not sure how much further they can be bid up.


> - Bear Index ETFs

Just sell index futures, it's less costly

>- Put Options

Implied vol is sky high right now, options are incredibly expensive - but you do know what you're betting before going in.

> - Defensive ETFs/stocks

2020-03-09	19:14:57	Yes.

For single stocks everything is going to be impacted by these shocks in a slightly different way. You need to actually do some due diligence and work out your own valuation on a stock by stock basis, then lay the technicals and momentum on top of that. In a lot of cases you will find yourself in the position of lacking critical information on the impact of the shocks at the present moment.

For index ETFs I want to wait and see if anything implodes first, then I would look for big sectors that may drag an index down. 

I am bargain hunting myself, by the way, so its not like I’m saying you should never buy."	ASisko	0

2020-03-06	21:33:37	I’d steer clear, they just cut 25-35 bps across their loan book this week with another rate cut potentially next month to come which will send the stock even lower. Most of their deposits are in lower cost deposits so they don’t have capacity to pass on cuts to deposit holders so their net interest margins get squeezed. That’s before we start talking about the million other issues such as compliance costs, regulator scrutiny, pervasively low rates for years to come with the prospect of QE in the future and a flat yield curve.	mtoner98	0
2020-03-07	03:16:29	I think they're probably one of the best of the big banks. However if rates stay low for a long period of time, which is likely they're gonna struggle. They've all got a low yield curve at the moment.	Cuzzamuluzza	0

2020-03-06	22:00:16	Keep in mind WBC doesn’t have a CEO and is about to cop a hefty fine for breaching money laundering regulations so that’s why the yield is so high/P/E is so low. Also I think all of them except CBA will have to cut that divvy. That being said if you forced me at gunpoint to buy one id probably buy WBC  because the valuation gap to CBA (it’s closest comp) is the widest it’s ever been in history and you could put a carrot in charge of a big 4 bank and it would probably outperform some of the recent bank CEOs we’ve had. The recent ones have been so shit, not having a CEO might even be a competitive advantage.	mtoner98	0

But in saying that, there in a highly competitive space, have pretty well no moat and I just can't see a big runway for growth with a traditional bricks and mortar travel agent business. 

For those reasons i wont be investing. But it could rebound hard (as with all travel stocks) and may be good for a trade or hold for a year but wouldn't long term it. I think I'd prefer Webjet over HLO anyway. There Webbeds section of the business is booming and I think the ecommerce space is better. 

Your thoughts?"	Sawltea	0
2020-03-05	02:31:08	"Mostly looking for them back at their 200 EMA. So CSL at ~$265. XRO decent for an entry at $72. APX I already have a position that im comfortable with but would add <$20. A2m is my largest holding and think it's decent value now, but becomes great value and would add <$14. Wont be making massive positions due to risk however as they could retrace alot further than that. 

On a broader scale, looks like long term trend line for Dow Jones is around 24000 and XJO (ASX) at 6100 which there's every chance it will close on. Could rebound there, or if it breaks, spells bad news. 

But overall, just looking for the volatility to settle a bit. Happy to miss out on the first few gains before making a move.

Not too much in there though, my second stock AMS is getting pounded at the moment, but I think they'll both be good in the long term. 

Hmm, I think it'll last maybe 2-3 months if im to hazard a guess. It's all psychological at this point, headlines ramping up the fear, businesses suffering because of people shutting down workplaces. When we realise it's no more significant than the flu and the people it's killing are only the people who would die of something else anyway.. Shit will go back to normal. Fear mongering can only last so long before people get bored of talking about the same thing that hasn't actually changed anything and we move onto the next hot topic. Maybe the US election will be more interesting. 
Purely a Psychological analysis.. Unsure how long the market would take to recover after all the fear, but id assume bottom sits somewhere around the time pandemic is officially called somewhere.

All these events could compound together of course.

2020-02-29	03:18:26	"I bought in around $1.20 and have researched this stock quite heavily while following the coronovirus, and remain bullish on it. The only time I have been dissapointed was when the CEO sold a large chunk of shares at a fairly big discount to its high but he still holds 40% of the company.

It is very different from normal sanitisers and the killer application is that it works while dry and has much longer longevity. It kills germs and viruses 'mechanically' - literally puncturing the structure of cells, instead of chemically. A hand sanitiser is only as effective as the last time you touch your runny nose. Zoono will continue to kill the coronovirus for the whole day every time you sneeze into your hands.

I always have had two key observations on this stock:
- I was fairly confident the german lab results would return positive, as zoono has been tested many times before and seems to have a general effectiveness against germs and viruses. Now the results are out and this is priced in.

- It will be in a very strong position now with official test results to receive very large commercial orders from government and businesses who will see it as an effective preventative measure in key population centres eg schools, hospitals, trains, busses, airports, offices, etc.

Everytime I watch the news the biggest message experts are trying to get across is washing hands is the most important thing to do, much more effective than facemasks. 

However this is like a war against human behaviour. People are gross. There are disturbing stats on the number of people who don't even wash their hands after taking a shit. 

So let's take a facility like a school - It would be an impossible task to ensure something as common as a handrail never gets contaminated. You can't hire a cleaner to stand by every doorknob and wipe it down with an alcohol rub every time a kid touches it.

However Zoono bonds to hard surfaces and works while dry, so handrails, tables, chairs, etc only needs to be applied with zoono once every few weeks and will continue to kill the virus as it comes into contact with it. 

This is such an easy sell to a public health authority to make an order for every school in a country to significantly reduce transmission risks economically and effectively.

You apply Zoono once and it creates a anti-microbial shield for 24 hours (which has now successfully tested effective against covid-19).

If you are in charge of reducing spread of viruses in every school in new south wales (or California,or Hong Kong, or the UK...), are you going to buy litres and litres of liquid soap kids have to apply every 40 minutes, or a smaller order of zoono and get them to apply it once at the start of the day?"	fryloop	0

2020-03-01	04:26:09	"You should try to be sceptical about non-independent tests (even if they say it is independent but they are the ones commissioning the tests).

There are plenty of other companies making the exact same false claims with the exact same product really (whether the active ingredient is benzalkonium chloride or ammonium chloride, both of which Zoono has indicated in the past) such as Nano Pure, Siqura and they've been debunked (for example, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655319300082 and https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/t/does-it-work-this-promises-to-protect-your-hands-from-germs-for-24-hours/vp-AAFchmL)

You can find an example of people testing Zoono in the real world (though maybe you could say they didn't test it properly for the longer time test).
http://www.dranniesexperiments.com/hand-sanitizer-testing/zoono-ultra-hand-sanitizer-independent-testing-and-review

Zoono don't have any revolutionary tech. It's just basic ingredients that plenty of other companies and businesses already use for hand sanitizers. However, claims of 24 hours efficacy are very irresponsible now in the face of an epidemic/pandemic because these things won't protect you for hours. Feel free to join in the pumping and dumping, but I would definitely not recommend you trust this product for your own use."	Jumbalumba	0

WOW - Kaufland didn’t set up shop here after all due to economic conditions, WOW is the biggest (and in my opinion best) supermarket, spinoff of their alcohol, gambling and hospitality businesses should mean they get picked up by ethical funds.

JBH - very defensive consumer durable stores in destination locations. They know their brands (good guys vs JB for the older and younger crowds). They make up a majority of the white goods market (around 60pc). Harvey Norman is a jackass and putting his directorship over performance.

They haven’t merged their supply chain of Good Guys and JB together so I found out the other day. With their new warehouse lease they can hopefully get on top of that and deliver a decent chunk of value there."	HeckingLoveDogs	0

2020-02-26	17:42:07	MM sector is busted atm. On the technicals unless you are trading bounces there is no obvious reversal signal at all. You can try to pick the bottom but the trend is intact and AGH is likely going lower. Only saving grace is AGH is indeed partnered with Cannvalate and has the largest patient numbers in Aus iirc. Problem is, market doesnt care. MM needs another bullrun then AGH will likely have another run again, if not punters just arent interested. Its still technically a speculative stock, not a mature company and earnings in no way constitute its 80M MC. If sentiment changes for the MM sector again then it could be a good buy. Depends on whether you think market cares about oils sales or not, because so far across the board in all Aus MM stocks like AGH,IHL, AC8, MXC every oils sale growth and patients ann have been ignored by the market.

2020-02-27	03:19:16	"Depends if you consider IP as the end all be all or not.

If so, only novel two are IHL and BOT on ASX. Others like ZLD IMO aren't novel and the market has agreed because they have sold off even successful trial results for ZLD. IHL first trial to come Q2 2020 but with BOT, market did notice their Phase 1 Acne and it pumped, but with the inconclusive Phase 2, it got dumped.

But the fact that the market reacted to the trial versus other MM 'trials' with no NOVEL product says it all really.

If you think generic oils sellers will somehow eventually make profit then anyone partnered with Cannvalate will be the only ones that succeed. This is because Cannvalate is AUS largest distributor and has 50% market share iirc. They are the biggest and the best, if you're not with them you will sell fuck all.

Take BDA for example, not with Cannvalate and took them about a year to get 300-400 patients. IHL with Cannvalate for 3 months gets 1K patients... AGH with Cannvalate for over a year, gets 5K+ patients...

In that case, AGH, IHL and MXC. I'd be wary of MXC, and Cannvalate is actually now the No.2 and will be soon No.1 major shareholder of IHL. Conflict of interest is there IMO and they will market IHL products before anything else. AGH still market leader though, so if you believe that oils sales is still the way for MM then they are the safest bet."	Exalted_HC	0

Italy, with one of the worlds most fragile overindebted banking systems has a bad infection. It could be greece but 10x worse if it collapses.

At this point you can only speculate on how bad it's going to get. If you think it will get worse, play defensively. If you think it's going to blow over, buy growth stocks as they will rebound.

There is no share you can buy to take guaranteed advantage of the situation because the future of the spread and damage of this virus is highly uncertain.

2020-02-24	19:52:16	"**CG1** - long idea, $45m market cap, powdered and pelleted activated carbon - the sort power plants can use to remove pollutants.

A product you think would be pretty commoditisable but their carbon is US made and is non-brominated (process patented). 

However, the idea is not about long term moat and more around a momentum around a step-change in revenues for FY2020, becoming cash flow positive and announcing signing more customers.

Latest quarter (Dec) was disappointing with only $3.9 m in cash receipts ($8.5 YTD) but
interestingly they ""re-affirmed"" previous guidance of $24-29m for the full year. Which seems
kinda unlikely given they would need to do $7-10m in the next two quarters. To do so they would likely need to sign new customers. Given management are so confident and they have mentioned they are ""discussing with several potential pallet customers"" it's likely there will be announcements about new customers soon. 
If they manage to meet guidance they would likely be cash flow positive. 

They IPO'd in 2018 at 70 cents and recently did a instutional cap raise at 40 cents which was oversubscribed. 
A large holder has recently sold to pie funds and capital H (who have worked together). 
Promoted on livewire by capital H in december here (https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/carbonxt-rapid-growth-inflection-point)

I'm not sure how to value it, but the cap raise was oversub at 40 cents so there's support there. 
AT 40 cents I think the upside potential is higher than the downside just looking at the short term and the next two quarterlies.
I guess the risk is management is shonky, which I haven't looked into, but a big assumption is that the instos that came in aren't completely clueless."	jopemop	0

ALU is the kind of stock you hold for 5+ years so if you’ve got the time horizon and are prepared to deal with some volatility it’s still a great company but I wouldn’t be buying it as a short term play.

I am deeply sceptical of Corona itself at the start, but this feels bigger than it actually is. From reading more into the subject, this feels like a bioweapon that shouldn't have leaked outside, rather than the official excuse of it being originated from 'exotic animal' from the Wuhan wet market. Containing HIV protein (as some countries have treated patient using HIV drug). Then again, I just read what I read. I wish I know more about the subject and virology. Just take this as tin foiled hat comment.

But back to investing,  I'll rather wait for the bottom to form if you are thinking of entering. If you are already long from a long time ago, I'll probably hold and ride it out and top up once bottom is confirmed. Never keen to catch a falling knife. But that's just me.

This is where everyday household items like light bulbs, door locks, fridges etc will start to contain more complex electronics to allow communication with each other.

Theres a lot of tinfoil hat comments about military researxh which have grounds for being completely legit, but a leak of infevtious virus isn't one (in my opinion). 

No military lab would be that sloppy to leak a biologic. I'm an ex lab worker, its really not hard even in academia to contain infectious diseases. Handling staff wouldn't have been permitted to leave a facility until well after the incubation period, and it wouldn't have taken this long to map a protein/create a vaccine if it was something which had already had military level funding within a lab.
Staff would never physically touch the virus. Its all complete under fume cupboards and behind glass, either with inserts or robotics for handling. 

The paper which found HIV inserts hasn't been peer reviewed and the author flat out said hes not claiming those proteins were inserted by humans. FYI if you weren't aware, the sequences are not specific to HIV, they're found naturally in many other viruses, just not in other known coronaviruses to date.

2020-02-21	16:15:12	"TL;DR - lazy, unimaginative and unoriginal politicians have fucked us in the longer term.

The quote below is from this article ([Philip Lowe leaves government ministers frustrated](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/economics/gdp-largely-unaffected-by-bushfires-says-rbas-dr-philip-lowe/news-story/7ffac782f1febf8e0935a5cb8aa5790c)) in The Australian on the 5th of Feb this year.

&#x200B;

>The Morrison government is ­increasingly frustrated with ­Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe’s calls for it to spend more to lift the ­nation’s flagging productivity, after a confidential cabinet briefing from the RBA boss on Monday left ministers exasperated by an absence of detailed policy ideas.  
>  
>Dr Lowe in a speech on ­Wednesday again exhorted the ­Coalition to do more to foster business spending as he highlighted a “troubling decline in productivity growth”, despite “fantastic” economic fundamentals. “While the reasons for this are complex, it is hard to escape the conclusion that higher levels of investment spending would promote productivity growth and our collective living standards,” he said.

This is Australia's problem in a nutshell. Our politicians have fucked themselves (and us) over by playing partisan/popular politics. They are increasingly reliant on government bureaucrats to present them with a buffet of ideas for them to pick out the good ones. Policies being imposed on this country have their origins in nameless/faceless/unelected individuals. The problem with this is that there is zero accountability. Pollies can hide behind the veneer of 'expert committees' and those who inform the committees are never held accountable for their contributions.

The RBA to its credit is beginning the push back. Lazy politicians have turned to the RBA time and again to lower interest rates (because it worked in the past). Now that interest rates are at all time lows, lazy investors are pulling their money out of term deposits and are being forced to take on extra risk in the markets (which is what is driving up share prices). It's probably not the worst thing in the world as this will hopefully increase the velocity of money and therefore improve the economic health of this country. Having said that, when this thing inevitably goes tits up in a correction, every man and his fucking dog will be getting up the politicians for providing the conditions that allowed asset values depreciate (ala the RC into banking)."	innatangle	0

I am suggesting that the single most important thing you should be doing, is analysing real, fundamental factors. Make decisions based on reality, not what other people are doing. 

Your comment is similar to one I heard in another thread, “we’re in a bull market, act like it”. So saying that your actions should be dictated by only what the market is doing, eg “the time to be a bear is when the market acts bearish” is, I’m sorry to be blunt, fucking stupid. 

That is intrinsically against the core of what investing is. Ironically, if anything is speculating, it’s that attitude. The current bull *charge* we’re seeing is based not on news, or fundamentals, but emotion. That is fact. When companies are going up 40% in a month on *no news at all*, that is a market driving by human emotion. 

You are suggesting that people trade based on what the market is doing. Therefore, given what I’ve explained above, you are de facto suggesting that people trade based on the fact that everyone else is excited. You are suggesting people trade on the fact that prices are going up, and that’s it. *That is insane. That is trading with the herd for no reason at all. THAT is speculation and **not** investing.*

Edit: You can’t justify being up 40% as evidence of sound decision making. Of course your up, everyone’s up, it’s a bubble. People that threw their life savings into that stock market in 1997 would’ve been up 40% or more in 2000. You think that ended well for them?"	_charge_your_phone_	0

2020-02-21	16:34:05	"I call it lazy because it takes no effort whatsoever to cream money off the back of a few million stuck in a term deposit. My main beef with this approach is that if this money was circulating in the economy, than there is more opportunity for people lower down the food chain to scoop some profit as it passes from person to person.

Now I guess technically, this is money that banks can reloan to entrepreneurial individuals but Australian banks are so conservative these days, good luck getting a loan. That's not to say it's impossible, it's just so much harder and the bar has been raised again courtesy of the royal commission. In our efforts to protect the retards from drilling themselves financially, we're cruelling the chances of some some risky plays that might actually come off.

Australia is ranked among the world's best when it comes to research, it is a laggard when it comes to converting that research into a commercial product through startup funding. High wealth individuals who park their cash in term deposits are partly responsible for what has led us to this point.

There's a lot of things not to like about the US, but the one thing I can't ignore is how much easier it seems to be to attract seed funding. If they didn't have this attitude, then I wouldn't be in the position of being 75% up on TQQQ since July 7th last year. Or to put it another way, the tech sector is a significant contributor to the US economy and the US can thank its risk taking attitude for setting it on that path."	innatangle	0

I guess JCS's track record in terms of successful implementations is probably their strongest advantage. JCS is the #1 NetSuite partner globally by number of customers and has successfully completed 600+ ERP implementations. In terms of disruption, hard to do if you're not selling proprietary software, so I guess Riyo is their 'punt' at that.

2020-02-25	00:54:18	"Just wanted to chime in with an example. If you’re day trading and rarely hold positions overnight then it would be far easier with CommSec. 

For example, you buy some shares on Monday, sell them Tuesday then, cash-wise, your account would only go ’down’ by the brokerage on Wednesday. With the majority of brokers (I’ve had this with NABtrade and SW) you would need to have the purchase + brokerage in your account on Monday.

At least, that’s how I believe it works. Last trade I did with CommSec was Friday and the confirmation email said “We'll debit this from your settlement account on 25 Feb 2020”. With NABtrade/SW, I couldn’t have made the trade unless the settlement account already had at least the purchase + brokerage amount in it."	eintoll	0

2020-02-18	03:28:41	"Out of them all, I consider SDV as the best (disc: held - so I might be biased). But plenty of projects on the pipeline, diversified industry and management keep delivering so far. Exciting prospects. However, it's relatively expensive as well compared to others.

I used to like PET a lot until management decided to sell their stake and then potential problems with getting cash out of China make me hesitant from jumping in again. It's good they win some project in Brazil today. If they can make more of these diversified play (rather than all China), there is a chance the share price sentiment might reflect it.

CG1 and DEM looks interesting. I'm personally looking to buy CG1, but just waiting for prices to settle first. DEM (I don't really have much of an idea).

FLC looks good on paper, but boy... they burn cash like it's out of fashion... Share price action speaks volume. Avoiding it for now."	lunchpenny	0

2020-02-22	15:16:16	"Yes the water sector is definately the 2020 and beyond theme.. Invesco water ETF is soaring. All major investments funds and banks are now focussing on ESG investing, with water conservation being the top priority.

&#x200B;

In youre stock selection you have missed the one that is positioned for expotential growth. Companies in the water sector, in particular start ups, need huge amounts of capital spent on R & D, acquiring tech, marketing,staff and big $$$ spent on pilot projects of new tech. It takes many years for a new water tech to be proven and pass the most stringent testing requirements. This is why majority of water start ups fail. Its a very long, slow expensive process to build a new water company. 

Fluence corp (ASX.FLC) are the  standout on the ASX by a long way. Highly miss understood by the market. As a shareholder myself, i find it encouraging that you didnt mention it. Proves how miss understood it is.

Those who mention cash burn, need to understand how capital intense the water sector is, as ive written above. Fluence have invested heavily over the last 6 years in demonstration projects, partnerships, building manufacturing facilities globally and R&D. They are both a manufacturer and EPC. These other stocks you mention are not even close to the league Fluence is in. 2020 is the inflexion point for FLC where the above begins to pay off.

Currently has a market cap of $212 million AUD, however earnings are in $U.S, so market cap is $U.S 140 million.

2020 booked revenue is already $140 million U.S. Likely to be $180 million. The company has $25 mill cash, no debt and finance facilities with Generate Capital which have not been used yet.

Backlog of booked contracts currently $400 million AUD. With a market cap at half of that backlog, its the standout.

DEM,SDV,PET,PO3, these are all trading at many multiples of their revenues and have not spent the millions in $$$ required to make it in this sector. Not to say any of those stock prices dont perform well. Its a market and most will buy whats going up, not down. 

You are correct with the sector though. Water is the new oil. Watch this space."	seasidere	0

The technology is a leader in its field and I have not come across better management in all my time investing. (Utting is the picture perfect MD you want at the helm of your company).   


You've hit the nail on the head with your summation of the other companies. I followed PET all the way up to $1.40 last year and only in the last 1-2 weeks have been convinced that prices look reasonable and been accumulating. Management do seem to over-promise and then under-deliver from what I have seen so that is somewhat of a red flag.

I just built my own porftolio when it comes to ASX stocks. So I kinda put my money into two buckets, one for short term trading and other one for the classic longer term position trading/investing.

But for overseas exposures, I used both ETFs or managed fund. Beside VTS, I also bought MHH in the IPO and bought WGB from time to time since it's trading at discount to NTA.

Also invested in MXT, hybrids and some ASX listed bond (recently bought VAHHA).

2020-02-16	12:27:43	"I know you didn't ask for it, but here are my thoughts on your watch list, feel free to ignore just thought I'd post in case you were interested

- CBA: very safe company, literally #1 in Australia by market cap. Good dividend, almost unthinkable that it will ever collapse. Only downside is that it's overvalued right now in my opinion. 

- WEB: Seems a well run business selling at a reasonable price. However, travel is arguably the worst sector to be in during a downturn (which I feel may be coming soon, though admittedly everyone and their mum has been saying this for several years now), and I also don't think there are sufficient barriers to entry that shield webjet from future big international competitors swooping in and taking market share. 

- BUB: Infant formula market is an interesting area due to the big market in China. However, they recently suffered a big drop due to weakening overseas sales. Also it's concerning to see negative net income in a company that has been around for a fair while. I'm actually putting this on my watch list, too, but definitely not convinced enough to invest as of yet

- PAR: Not even going to pretend I understand their business or their drug. Maybe they'll succeed, maybe they won't. I don't work in or know the field so I'll personally be steering clear, but if you're in the position to make a more informed choice then by all means go ahead. 

As for my watch list: 

- TGR: had a massive 11% rise last week, which annoyed me because I've been watching them for ages but haven't bought. Still decent value though imo. Consumer staples so relatively robust in a downturn, established asx 300 company, good revenue growth (though admittedly net income growth is less convincing). I'm happy with company outlook and prospects, plus they pay a good dividend. 

- MFD: very small cap so risky, but imo good value with a massive dividend yield and a P/E of only 10. Net income Growth is inconsistent but generally trending positive. 

- IFN: in my opinion renewables will inevitably grow eventually, and IFN seems like one of the few asx listed renewables companies big enough to make a splash. Consistent revenue growth since 2015, same for net income except 2019. P/E of 16ish is reasonable for a company I expect to grow. 

- RFF: still suffering from the accusation of being a Ponzi scheme a few months back, and it's this very accusation that makes me hesitant, because without it id definitely buy in. 20ish P/E is a little high but I'm a believer in the sector long term and the dividend yield and 4 yearly payments are very attractive. Just watching for now and weighing up the risk."	operationmeepo	0

2020-02-15	01:42:01	"Firstly, I want to say I appreciate your contributions to this sub. You clearly put time into your posts and add plenty.

I do disagree with your opinion with Webjet. The company's operating profit margin has increased substantially year on year on the back of the most exciting part of the company being their webbeds business that you glossed over in your first sentence. This is their vehicle for future growth. It's revenue alone on this part of company increased something stupid like 80% in their last update. Sorry I can't remember the exact number off the top of my head and I'm also currently a few beers deep (so you might want to confirm that exact number haha). 

I certainly agree that coronavirus can play havoc on their B2C business and google is also an issue although they did just recently come out and dispute that little traffic comes from google searches as their marketing is focused elsewhere. This is debatable given google's sheer size, they can certainly disrupt the market with their financial pull. So there are genuine risks.

I'm of the opinion that it is a long term hold. Also generally where there is smoke, there is fire so the recent updates about possible takeovers are of significant interest to me too. As you can tell I'm a shareholder and bought in around the $3 mark. Just wish I didn't sell half my holdings back around 2016."	IBetrayedTV	0

Is the takeover talk real? Is that keeping the price up?

I have the *blended* PE from commsec as **19%** \- more comfortable than your 27% based on last year's earnings. 

The **ROE** is a real worry. It has continued to fall over the past few years. Growth is costing much more.

But the **CEO** John Guscic has proven doubting markets wrong every time over the past 10 years. Very smart guy.

It's a tough one. I own it. I think Guscic can keep going... but its more faith than clear evidence the current price is particularly good value.

Price to Book Ratio (P/B) — 2.17 which is mid-range

Debt to Equity Ratio —0.48. <0.5 is what i consider ""good"".

Return on Equity (ROE) — 11.27% which is lower than I'd like. 

Price to Sales Ratio (P/S) — 2.8, which places it in the top 5 P/S for its sector. 

Current Ratio — 2.25 which is fine.

Dividend — 38c. Increased for the last 5 years but will probably stall this FY.

In my opinion TWE is undervalued because the company is fundamentally good but high risk. I suspect the MACD will cross in the next few days as the stock finds a new support level. It's too early to buy in my opinion, I'd wait a few days to see what price action does. I suspect we'll see a reversal to $15 in the long-term. Buy around $11."	Thieving6	0
2020-02-15	18:45:44	"Short term: TWE pays for all product (grapes) upfront and only sees revenue for said product 2-3 years down the line. Short term Margins will be compressed as product gets more expensive and more scarce. 

Midterm: China's middle class is growing rapidly and this has seen a dramatic increase mid-low cost wine competition across China, which is treasury's largest market. Couple with high upfront cost and price reduction to keep up with competition. Midterm margins will be compressed

By extension TWE faces short term and medium term issues which will ultimately impact the long term business. This is the recipe for a long ranging and/or decline stock price. The bulls are in control and will be for a while. Best to just put it on a watch list.

2020-02-13	03:35:58	I have to say you are wrong about Microsoft. Probably the best company in the world. They are going to be at the front of the cloud game with azure.	levinj	0
2020-02-13	15:30:27	"Microsoft has far to go before saturation.

Azure is only just starting and they are starting to win over customers from AWS.

Large corporations are only beginning to move over core services to cloud. Most of this infrastructure sucks and will be expensive IaaS, larger corporates are going multi cloud for core services so will have 2 providers for core products.  Palo Alto and security do demand a premium, azure gives them a market place to sell these products as service and no doubt take a cut.

Products are going subscription based everything from office 365, windows and Xbox.  Games need to be hosted somewhere on the cloud. E sports is growing , streaming games both video and actual games is just beginning. Subscriptions reduce piracy and help licensing. How many people now pay for Netflix vs torrent.

Microsoft, Oracle and IBM have massive relationships with governments who are starting to move to cloud. Azure has a focus on governance and data sovereignty that will help it win governments. It was the first cloud to be approved by the FBI allowing all the other law services in the USA to use it. Then recently one JEDI so expect smaller NATO countries to follow. Oracle and IBM cloud suck and don't have the cloud size to sell. Selling cloud only really becomes super profitable once you reach a certain scale. MS has just reached that size so expect margins to grow. Growing margins will give it more room to compete with price. 

GitHub so much potential to cross sell Azure, only a matter of time before they integrate it better to Azure DevOps and the Azure cloud.

Microsoft has potential to sell more software. SharePoint sucked and was an ass too host. How many companies still have 3 sharepoints running .. these will move to cloud as SaaS.
 They suck less on the cloud as ms hosts them and they are better products on the cloud version. Same goes for CRM, ERP, database and Skype / teams.

Operations stuff are grumpy bastards who won't do anything without vendor support especially for core services. Need someone to blame when things go wrong so they will engage Microsoft services a lot more during transition or possibly Accenture.  Still more cash for MS customers lining up.

Devices Microsoft has sucked at this. But again it has enormous potential. If it fixes the Microsoft store and integrates it with Azure it could cross sell surface tables and Samsung notes through an employee self surface portal using existing Azure Ad auth and  Integrated billing that already exist for azure. Less middle men taking cuts from ms and employees could order hardware direct with policy for rules.   

Everyone thinks Microsoft has capped out , it's a trillion dollar company etc. Yeah it's a trillion dollar company that pays a dividend is still growing. If it wasn't a trillion dollar company people would be buying it a lot more.  People are literally being scared off buy the market cap and buying speculative SaaS companies that run on Azure/aws that have yet to make a profit instead.  I think a lot people still think MS  is the same company it was in 2000s they are a lot more than just a software company now. Revenues and margins are awesome , and the revenues are getting stickier!  If anything I'd expect a SaaS bust for all these smaller companies with a pe in the hundreds.
 
I missed the migration stories about older windows going out of support ! Large retailers not wanting to work with AWS.. 

Also missed the bing story. So bing sucked bad and so does IE and and Edge. Bing no longer sucks it's usable but hey Google is the default in chrome and why would I ever change it. Expect this too change for a lot of people with the next windows. MS will have a chromium browser as the default and it will work for more than downloading chrome.  This will feed traffic to bing and bring in advertising money.

You could literally write a book on why to buy MS at the moment and you would probably still miss a lot reasons on why to buy."	moreRelevantBacon	0

If you're looking for just the straight highest yield then look no further than whc, 10% yield per dividend, 20% annual. Good valuation and P/E ratio. What's the downside you ask? Well It's a coal mining company, so make your own judgement about its future. 

A lot of companies like WOW and WES pay good dividends and are good businesses (imo) but are very overvalued at the moment (again, just my opinion).

2020-02-11	06:16:16	"P/E of 50 isn't necessarily overpriced.  Growth companies aren't priced on earnings they're priced on future earnings growth.  So you'd be better looking at something like a PEG ratio if you're into fundamental analysis.  The issue with all growth companies is they are great on the ride up but if ever their earnings growth falls short of market expectations they are going to get slaughtered on price.

I think the other thing is it's much harder to make a $6,000,000,000 company into a $12,000,000,000 company (= 100% growth) than it is to make a $6m company into a $12m company (= 100% growth).

2020-02-12	12:35:26	"The TPG/Vodafone decision is due today, 10:30 i believe...

Morgan Stanley analyst tips the TPG share price will go up to $8.70 if approved, and down to $5 if merger rejected, so there is potentially a lot ridding on the decision. 

If the merge is rejected i could be a reasonable buying opportunity for TPG for those wanting to be a holder. I dont recommend them personally due to the way the business operates, thats my personal opinion, but i expect the market will strongly over-react if rejected and its not the end of the world for TPG.

&#x200B;

Telstra, its complicated...

Telstra share price could also see significant movement, when TPG announced the merger and that they wouldnt be rolling out a 4th network TLS share price went up, it was at a near all-time low at the time IIRC over concerns about mobile margins.

In theory the merger will be approved if it increases competition (or at least doesnt reduce it), so the merger approval should be bad for Telstra, but the merged entity is probably a less serious threat than an aggressive fourth entity.

Vodafones CEO is less aggressive than TPG's CEO, and Vadofones CEO will take over if approved, so there are plusses and minuses for Telstra.

Its really about what will happen to TPG's spectrum, will be used, or will it sit idle, that is beyond the decision of the court, we will need to see the reaction to the decision to see how it effects Telstra.

&#x200B;

I think the market is very much expecting the approval to go ahead, so the biggest movement will likely happen if rejected.

I dont think it will be the end of the world for TPG if the merger is rejected;

* They have low costs and good cashflow,
* They could still do some limited rollout (fixed wireless), if they wanted to.
* They still have a joint venture for spectrum, and might be able to co-operate on spectrum without a formal merger (but there is potentially another legal case about it).

If the merge is approved;

* It still needs to be approved by the Foreign Investment Review Board, and that might not be that easy, the merged entity will be majority foreign owned (at least for a couple of years when there is a planned sell down). In the mobile space only one of three majority Australian owned. Sinophobia might come into it as well.
* There a lot of risk in the merger, very different cultures, and they are merging with a business that has continually lost money, no guarantees it will become profitable just because a merger. It could sap there cashflow for a decade before it turns around.
* There is a lot of work to do, TPGs business practices have been deliberately neglected for a long time (management style) and mergers can be complicated (i say as a Vocus holder)"	9aaa73f0	0

2020-02-10	18:03:49	"A good summary. XRF is currently my biggest position so I try and stay current on the company/valuation.

Some comments:

Agree with your point on management. They have been around since the start of this re-investment phase and have purchased shares at higher prices over the years. Also I've been told by the CEO that many non-Director employees have done the same but of course don't have to disclose to the market.

I actually think being in a difficult to service niche is a competitive advantage in itself. XRF has a dominant global market share in XRF furnace machines (from memory \~60% global market share, though China is difficult to measure) which is a deterrent from serious capital entering the market.

They are largely tied to mining production rather than prices directly. While there is obviously a connection between the two, there can be a serious lag before production adjusts to price (you often need sustained price falls before miners will adjust mine plans). That said, the one price they are leveraged to is lithium because it is a core input to the consumable flux product. That said the falling lithium price has been a major driver of profitability over the last year or so.

I think your FY20 and FY21 NPAT projections are light. I think it is more likely they do $3-3.5m NPAT in FY20 and then $4m+ in FY21. It is difficult to project further out than that because future growth is heavily reliant on the success of the new platinum products (current NPAT growth largely from mean reversion of margins).

I'm fairly bullish on the potential of the new platinum division to drive profits longer term, though management could do better at explaining the new division and how it moves them into a complementary new vertical that is higher margin and much less cyclical."	Wini9	0
2020-02-10	02:20:06	"XRF are levered to commodity prices, so it's basically an above-ground mine with all of the risks (capital intensive, no pricing power) but with none of a mines advantages (option-value, ability to generate economic rent etc). 

>Expected EPS growth: 14% annually
>Earnings projected forward at 5 years

Really? We're 11 years in an anemic economic recovery that is long of tooth. What makes you think XRF are going to double their EPS in 5 years? Lithium carbonate/spodumene prices are at 3 year lows but I would expect it to rise given the exponential rise of EVs and grid storage. This is not good for XRF which are a lithium price taker."	the_shitpost_king	0

2020-02-11	01:09:20	"you bring up some great points. I didn't know that XRF had almost 60% market penetration, i may go over their most recent annual presentation.  Regarding, my forecasts, I general always tend to air on the conservative side as it is better to under promise and over deliver in a sense. 

According to your numbers of $4m NPAT, the stock prices forecast is \~0.4 in FY21. Huge upside and larger than my numbers. I've done some mild research into the lithium industry as a whole and i believe the price of ;lithium will remain stagnate for the remainder short to medium term. Lithium is absolutely abundant within the earths crust and miners small to large have capitalized and created a massive oversupply where almost 50% of lithium miners have had to scale back production. I think price will remain steady at the worst and continue to trend down as the best. 

The platinum division is something i am also bullish on, this core area of the business has been historically stable and the re-manufacturing process of the business is somewhat a recurring stream of revenue and offers more stability looking forward. 

I hold a fairly medium sized position in XRF compared to others in my portfolio and will be looking to increase soon within the next coming weeks, the dividend is great as well."	chase_hendrix	0

2020-02-11	01:32:00	"From memory the market share came from a broker report I read a while back, I will see if I can dig it up.

Yep, I've got a price target of 40c on the stock, but over the next 12 months or so. I have factored in some multiple expansion which may be a bit rich, but I believe if XRF management can better explain their business model to the market it can reach 15-17x earnings. They aren't as cyclical as you would think at face value, and they have a great razor/razorblades model with the consumables.

Also, you are referring to the core platinum division of selling crucibles with their new machines, then offering re-manufacturing services after melting them down which does have an element of recurring revenue. However, I am referring to the new precision platinum products they are selling through their German office.

As I said, management probably haven't explained the opportunity well, but this is manufacturing extremely customised platinum parts for advanced manufacturing clients (aerospace, healthcare, measurement, etc.). It is leveraging their existing platinum manufacturing experience/equipment, but targeting much higher margin clients and diversifying away from mining.

This new division is close to reaching breakeven after spending roughly $6m on expansion over the last few years. It represents massive upside to the share price if they can not only stem the losses but reach the profitability management believes it could."	Wini9	0
2020-02-23	13:37:09	A very strong 1H result from XRF on Friday. $1.6m NPAT puts them on track for my numbers of $3-3.5m FY. Commentary suggests further growth in the 2H so likely at the top end of that range. I think it moves into the mid-30's over the next few weeks as people digest this report and a large holder is slowly flushed out.	Wini9	0

2020-02-06	03:14:28	Cathay Pacific has just put 24,000 staff on unpaid annual leave. I know it’s not Qantas but as restrictions continue and people stop flying this will get worse before it gets better especially since those stocks are already overvalued. Three cruise ships are quarantined off the coast of Asia and there isn’t a cure yet for this. While there is active media coverage and hype those affected companies will continue to drop in my opinion. If not now than during lower than expected earning reports in Q1	brokeassmillionaire	0

2020-02-05	15:47:43	"Look aside from the number of units you want to buy.

Look at the raw growth and returns.

For example:

$1000 to buy 10 shares at 10% growth is $1100.
$1000 to buy 100 shares at 10% growth is also $1100.

These ETFs are expensive because they touch so many underlying companies and the companies you want to invest in are already stupid expensive.

Personally I’d suggest pick a top 100 or 200 index and just roll with it. Don’t just limit yourself to the ludicrously expensive tech stocks.

Also, I’m a tech guy, and I know tech stocks. So I know what I want to buy. Forgive me but it seems a bit like you’re chasing vertical growth and not necessarily because you like the companies.

I personally think Facebook and Google need to get the shit beaten out of them for their awful privacy track record. And I am ethically opposed to investing in them."	HeckingLoveDogs	0
2020-02-05	17:11:08	"Thanks. I appreciate the considered response.

I get the math, its the psychology of it i struggle with. But i know you're right. :)

I dont think Microsoft is comparatively overvalued. P/E of around 30 is overvalued i guess, this is becoming weirdly normal. But software is essential, the utility pricing of subscriptions is a river of money, its almost recession proof, the cost of new revenue is effectively 0 (adding new subscribers doesnt cost much, selling cars requires you to build 2 cars for example) and they are heavily investing capital in things like European Renewable where the UK have just announced the end of New fossil fueled cars - in terms of return on capital and future value for relatively young companies, i think the real growth is yet to come. But rather than buy them and sit on them, these fund managers are actively trading them - something i could never do. Anyway, this is my thinking. Might not be right.

I am chasing sustained growth in industries i think are super resilient. the new banks i guess?

I like you point on Facebook and google and i divested myself of ASX:AMP for this exact reason."	JimmyTheHuman	0
2020-02-05	19:40:50	">	in terms of return on capital and future value for relatively young companies

I don’t know what to say, I fundamentally disagree with you here.

They have market share in the desktop space, but that is factored into the price already.

Apple laptops and desktops are gaining ground, Linux is kicking ass in the server space.

Also Amazon and Oracle will fight for the cloud services pie.

In my opinion you’re betting that consumers won’t have any competition and that Microsoft will always prevail and that regulation isn’t going to kick their ass. I fundamentally hate that and will always think that is going to change."	HeckingLoveDogs	0

At u/akkatracker says. Revenue is actually growing, that isnt theory.

I dont have the stats handy on desktop market share or the size of the desktop business. But the market for Windows 10 on a $500 device isnt being replaced by MacBookPros any time soon.

Apple is a hardware and music business. Microsoft is a subscription based software business, i dont think they are competing like they were in the 90s.

Microsoft competitors are AWS and Oracle to some degree.

again - i dont intend to buy MS and sit on them and hope. I want to invest in experts who are trading them. Its one of the reasons i like Magellan and Hamish Douglas - they are focused on a handful of the worlds premium companies....so far they are doing pretty good!

2020-02-05	14:17:18	"All these other posts have been pretty shit to be honest, but that's usually the case of ""herrr derrr gold bad"". 

The problem with buying gold companies now is that it's still cyclical to some extent, and you would be buying nearing all time highs for the price of gold. Gold companies profit are PoG - AISC (all in sustaining cost). Ideally this is below $1200/oz. So you're still betting that either margins stay where they are at or widen, price of gold increases or your company of choice finds higher grades (g/t) or extends life of mine (LoM). 

In terms of best grades/LoM/cheap producer, I don't think any company can beat KLA. I think they average 20g/t but they're also Canada/US based so there's more to think about. Also good chunk shortsold.
NST has just bought a stake into the superpit at Kalgoorlie and would probably be my pick to outperform the majority of other gold stocks going long.

So if the daily virus infection rate isn't kept in subdued numbers from friday onwards, further panic could start and markets affected accordingly. Generally speaking WHO were quite impressed with China's efforts and the virus should be kept under control within the next coming weeks, I think, wait it out the price may fall further in the coming weeks, we may get word out of management as to how extensive cashflow may be affected. but if you're looking long term, buy now and hold hold hold.

The fact that the Chinese government removed short selling options on the open yesterday is more of a concern. This restriction should be removed in a week - but it is likely to cause the Friday panic in US markets we have seen over the past two weeks (with no one wanting to hold risk into a two day news cycle).

2020-02-04	11:07:27	"Just my personal opinion about the business and its demographic without really delving into financials;

I am someone who is a huge consumer of boutique shave products. Double edged safety razors, shaving creams, double edge blades, boar brushes etc. I can safely say that I've only ever stepped foot into a Shaver Shop store once in my life, and couldn't believe how overpriced it all was. 

Whilst standing in store - I thought ""Why is this here? Why is this not just online?"" I could make a case if the staff were master barbers or had extensive knowledge with shaving, but it was just a teenage girl with absolutely no idea about anything Shaving related.

I feel people who are into these niche products are in my age bracket. Roughly between 16-35 years of age. I would comfortably say that nearly EVERYONE in this bracket can order online (from Amazon, Mensbiz, Shaving.ie etc) and would receive a much better price with delivery to your door.

I'll juxtapose this with the example of Flight Centre (FLT). Their main business model centres around Australia's ageing population, and streamlining the booking process (mainly for those who can't do it themselves). This is why, although they do have an online presence, they mainly use brick and mortar locations. I feel this is because of the age demographic they target, perhaps in the 40-70 bracket.

With absurd prices, often unhelpful staff and rising competition from online competitors; it's a pass from me. However, I'm not factoring in diversified revenue streams like perhaps starting a ""Dollar Shave Club"" type service. Purely talking about the business' brick and mortar operations."	NervesOfShiel	0

2020-02-02	23:36:01	"Some really good points that i haven't considered greatly, I have done some research and here is my take.

1. Firstly, naturally competitors such as amazon and Kogan pose a huge threat to the business, but based on its current and past financials, there e-commerce giants have not eaten in to the bottom line as much as of yet (time will tell). Their new CRm experience will hopefully hit the right button and push their digital marketting forward greatly. 
2.  SSG doesn't just sell razors but they cater to male and female personal beauty and their products range from razors and gels or skin care, hair driers and everything in between. Also with the growing public image trend, Shaver Shop is in a great market.
3. Floor rents are set to increase and that is going to naturally eat into EBITDA. But management are currently in the process of buying the last 2 franchised stores and that will bring an extra $2.5 million in EBITDA. While, floor rents pose an issue, renegotiation will be integral for the future of the brand. this is  aspace i will watch."	chase_hendrix	0

I believe this is where we'll disagree. I think the business is aimed towards that 16-35 age bracket by offering a wide range of boutique products, alongside traditional disposal razors and electric shavers.

As a potential customer, I'd think; Why the Shaver Shop? What is the allure of going to a dedicated Shaver Shop rather than picking up an Electric Razor at Harvey Norman? Honestly the only reasons I could think of is either stellar customer service, or fantastic prices. 

In my opinion, Shaver Shops has neither. 

Have you ever been to a store, and looked around? What did you think? There is one close by to me at a Westfield Shopping Centre. Honestly, it's the smallest, dingiest looking shop around with no more than one staff member on at one time. 

However, I'd keep my ears open for anything Subscription based that the business plans to offer - or any other diversified revenue stream in general.

If you're looking for blue chips, I recommend going here to start: https://www.asx200list.com 

(I'm not affiliated with the linked site in any way)

This gives you a list of the asx 200 (200 biggest listed companies in terms of how much their total stock on the market is worth). The cool thing about it is you can sort this list by sector, market cap, alphabetically etc. 

This is only a starting point. Find a company in a sector that interests you on the list (companies vary but generally speaking: IT and biotech companies are high risk, high reward, with a focus on growth and not huge dividend, energy and utility companies tend to not be huge growth but pay good dividend, I could go on forever but basically each sector has their own traits that also, as mentioned, vary widely across companies). After you've found a company you're interested in, check their net income growth, P/E ratio (high P/E is ok if you're expecting a company to grow a ton, but if it's a more defensive investment a low P/E is ideal, like 15-20ish) , debt level and cash flow (these can be found in reports or on most brokerage platforms). Read company reports but be aware that some sections are essentially a sales pitch and may look really positive but really not be so great. 

Check the news for any recent scandals etc. If you see that the price had dipped recently, ask yourself why? Look for any scandals, insider selling etc. If nothing concerns you, might be an opportunity to buy in. 

If you want dividends, you can search them by company code on the asx website to check a company's dividend history. 

As for micro/small caps, this is less my area but HotCopper or motley fool is fine for a start but, I cannot stress enough, NOT enough to justify a buy. If some random is making a convincing HotCopper pitch to you, go check that company's fundamentals as listed above, look at the news about them, consider their product and whether you think they have potential for growth (as others have said it helps if you have knowledge of the industry). 

The stock market isn't shutting down anytime soon, and there's always a new so-called ""next big thing"", so don't be afraid to wait around if nothing catches your eye. 

If it helps, a couple things I've got my eye on right now: 

Tgr, gmg, ast

All established companies unlikely to grow massively, but pretty ""safe"" (quotations because investing in shares always involves risk). 

I don't currently hold any of them, but you could have a look if you fancy, but obviously do your own research.

There's articles written about basically every decent company (Motley Fool for example, you don't have to follow their advice but can be a good source of where to start researching) and you can start creating a watch list/research list.	slothonreddit	0
2020-01-31	02:22:53	Start with a sector that interests you. One that you might know something about. e.g. forget Biomedical if you work in Woolies. Go for Retail instead. There's about 2000 companies on the ASX but doing that alone narrows it down to probably 200-300. Then pick the market cap range that interests you. High risk, mid cap or blue chip? Now you're down to a hundred. Then check the price chart over the last year for each. Remove the dogs. Now you've got 30. Go from there.	hidflect1	0

2020-02-02	14:33:07	"Sorry I'm a bit late - but it depends, OP. Are you asking in general, or specifically midcaps, specs etc?

I'd say in general - the best way for me - is word of mouth. Usually friends in finance or colleagues will mention a business and I'll do my own extensive DD. This can be extended to online forums like Hotcopper and other websites, but these usually carry more risk as you never know who you're talking to, or how dumb they are.

if you don't have these connections - you will some day. You'd be surprised at some of the intelligent and insightful investors that can be found out there (once you weed through the duds).

I'f I'm looking to trade - then iRess and a Stock Screener (like Barchart) are helpful. iRess enables live charts, announcements and a myriad of other benefits. A stock screener allows you to search for companies trading out of certain technical indicators. For example, you can search for a stock closing off a 52w low, between X and X cap, on increasing volume etc.

But the biggest tip I can give you - is to read and be patient. I started with some finance knowledge about 5-6 years ago, made plenty of stupid mistakes etc. But eventually after losing money, pursuing higher education and a thousands of hours of reading - I can safely say that it gets much easier.

Also - Google isn't completely out of the question. If you are interested in a particular sector, even a simple ""breweries on the ASX"" or ""DSO operations ASX"" can yield promising results."	NervesOfShiel	0

2020-01-31	01:29:20	"I think it's probably a function of elevated multiples. Because interest rates keep getting lower the market multiple is going higher. So when a stock on a higher than usual multiple puts out a downgrade, especially one where decent earnings growth is expected (like TWE and CWY) they get hammered way more than the quantum of the downgrade. This is probably partly because of fear of another downgrade, partly because the new growth expectation doesn't warrant the aforementioned high multiple. 

Not sure if that answers your question but hopefully it's a start."	lukemarlin	0

I get where you are coming from though.  And I think it is a relevant question to ask.

But I am sure you could go back and look at some very significant companies who have had a generally good track record and you will see some similar pull back.  

Look long term.  Look for the next 20 years.  TWE?  Well, I think that is fine.  NEA?  Well, that is maybe a different story.

They've also been involved in a few scandals in addition to the probe by the governor General.
I also read (a few months ago) that there is a possibility that their Sydney resort will be delayed?

2020-01-27	03:03:55	"IMHO I don’t like the big four banks at all at the moment.

Whatever fine they get from this class action will come directly out of dividends paid.

IMHO they effectively profiteered for years off mismanagement of their obligations knowing that it would be at their expense in the future. They’re lucky they got a pretty abysmal fine for their mismanagement.. but I think their momentum of endless growth will be slowed from here on.

I’ve seen more and more people switching to non core banks these days and I think their market share will gradually erode away as new age banks start being able to offer loans.

I’d consider buying some shares at a good margin of safety price, competition and looming fines might do some damage on their short to medium term profitability.

It’s anyone's guess, Just looking at there website the last bit of news they released was in Dec 19 and being that they own, well rural assets and infrastructure it could be a good idea to wait and see how the recent fires have effected their numbers before investing. 

Thomson Reuters down graded their score to 6 from 7 in Jan, Trading Central recently changed their Short Term View from Limited Rise to Limited Decline, Trading Central also changed their Medium Term View from Bullish to Range whilst Morning Star believes they’re undervalued and Mean recommends a “stong buy”. 

So your guess is as good as anybody’s personally I wouldn’t touch them until we see a financial report or some positive market indicators regarding their current asset quality after these fires as recently they’ve not said anything I can find. And remember whilst their assets may not be affected the profits might be due to fires burning out large hectares of land that provide food they may need to feed their cows so they may have to buy for a higher price elsewhere for example eating into profits. 

I make no recommendations buy at your own risk and research and the fact that I looked all this up in 10 minutes tells me your a lazy investor and probably just buy based on others opinions the fact you give none of your own analysis and ask people on reddit for theirs, big lol and good luck cos you gonna need it."

My guess would be that a drop is minimal if the capital raising was to fund a takeover or large investment that the market likes the look of but if it was to fund ongoing operations a larger drop is likely. Maybe the capital raising price is accounting for the dilution effect. 

I guess the question to ask is why would you want to pay more than the capital raising price prior to it occurring? I wouldn't want to, I don't want to pay more than anyone else is! Therefore the market should move towards the capital raising price over time."	domo_man91	0

The drug should pass most regulatory hurdles about safety as it's already prescribed for other purposes to people. 

It also needs to be prescribed every year so it's got reoccurring cash flows.

2020-01-21	19:43:59	"Having done a bit more research on Potash and KLL, I believe KLL has a strong potential to become the first mover to begin manufacturing SOP. 

>Kalium Lakes plans to initially spend $159 million on an 82,000 tonne per annum operation, before ramping up to 164,000 tonnes by investing an additional $125 million.  
>  
>Kalium Lakes will eventually look at increasing production to beyond the phase two target over the project’s estimated 30-year mine life.

The above points do make it quite attractive as a long term investment. 

Australia agriculture can also benefit a lot with local manufacturing of SOP which will assist in driving KLL up. Not to mention a large demand in SOP coming from China if they do plan to expand into international markets.

I feel like it would be a good buy and hold?"	Monk-On-Morphine	0
2020-01-21	23:07:27	I have shares in Salt Lake Potash SO4 and they've been the stock price darling of the sector in the past but I'm starting to have my doubts about project when compared to KLL.

2020-01-23	19:55:56	KLL has a world class resource with low impurities and extraction costs, quality management and a low cost of capital. It's worth noting that SOP is a product that is highly inelastic in demand and is growing in use year-on-year. Also, the marginal producers of SOP need to use KCl as a feedstock to make SOP which is very expensive and usually relegated to jurisdictions with low energy costs. KLL is in a sector that is hugely disliked and out-of-fashion (ag mineral prices have been getting smashed for years). For these reasons, I'm jacked to the tits with KLL.	the_shitpost_king	0

I also agree that the sector is growing in demand, especially in Australian production. And I hope KLL can maintain their favourable production price point. I'm also quite surprised that they don't have any debt! Just a lot of reasons to get in there and play the waiting game.

It's not something I'd imagine they could make cheap enough to compete with a big company like BHP, but if only one small company will prevail, that could mean them.

Targeting a very limited demographic though, so not much room for growth, and not very liquid, so not that confident that i would my own money on it, but could be bouncy.

It will be interesting to see the costs, and the margins, every major has said there is not much money in NBN retail, ABB have a $5 or $10 premium over others, but increased support costs due to Aussie service center, and not owning much (any?) fibre.

There will be much hype around ABB, and much pressure, they will have to become predator or prey, they wont survive in their original form for long, the premium market isnt that big, and its hard to break into enterprise.

The best thing they could do would be to merge with Superloop, they are the only other brand close to the premium market, and Superloop have a reasonable amount of fibe that would reduce ABB costs. Superloop could then leverage ABB access to POI for international commercial users. ACCC would probably even allow it as it would position them as a 5th fixed line integrated Telco.

Still not sure where AYS belong, if TPG+Vodafone gets rejected i expect TPG will move on AYS, they are both price seeker demographic.

AYS might be a good fit for Vocus, but it will be a few years before they would go back down that road of acquisitions.

Uniti is a wildcard, and Spirit could make some small acquisitions (maybe FSG, my tip)"	9aaa73f0	0

Also they say elsewhere that this benefits all investors, both private and institutional. Because of course they can't provide the institution with a discount card.

Banks: NAB used to waive credit card fees, but you had to own 500 shares. They also discontinued it.

To be completely honest, I'd rather a company perform well and pay out a dividend than throw fancy parties. When your company is running poor, the party or credit card fees waived will just be a consolation prize.

 Not sure what your question was, i think you just outlined a very bullish case. This company is still highly reliant on a key distributor being GE healthcare which is a downside and market is expecting high growth going forward, so it has high expectations built into the price.

They seem to be investing in quite a large number, thats for sure.

I don't own any of their shares yet, but I have been looking at them purely from the stance that I think other investors may like the ""feel good"" feeling about it. They have certainly seen some growth recently though."	tequese	0

The have a great product with a consumable and the product needs to be replaced every couple years, a great source of recurring cash-flow. A great management team that used to work for cochlear (look at their stock price) and they expense all R&D. SP is up 14% this year and they have new products soon.

I sold it (after the cash offer by Federation) because I'm not convinced the directors are creating any wealth for shareholders. Roger Price, in interviews, kept saying he thought the company was undervalued as it slid from $2 p/s to $0.7 p/s, yet, never bought a single on-market share. Now, they have the audacity to crystallize shareholder loss with an offer of $1 p/s. I'm getting out now to redeploy capital in more convex opportunities.

Sure, the federal government has created a lot of uncertainty within the sector, but surely projects in other jurisdictions could have buffered against this? Clearly, my thesis of optionality was wrong, or has not played out fully, yet."	the_shitpost_king	0

They look like they did make huge investments in 2018 and hence had low cash reserves. But they did have a significantly low total revenue. They also received funding from a PE firm in sept, and the demand for cleaner energy is always going to be increasing, exponentially so. 

However they don't track well against their competitors and have been held up by regulatory or operational factors.

Unless they show some real growth in the next set of financials, they might go under."	igetfourpointos	0

2020-01-10	17:51:43	"Telstra bled out it's monopoly over a long period of time.Back in 1999, what was their competition? Optus? That's about it. There were very few ISP's around, and Telstra dominated that sector too.

Entertainment like Foxtel was king, but is now dying out as there's far less demand for cable-TV. They were smart to work along side netflix, but I'm not sure if that really holds up in the market.

A year or so ago I moved from the $30 cap pre-paid to a $15 ALDI pre-paid (which uses the Telstra network) to get more data for half price. Telstra still end up getting some money out of me in that transaction, but significantly less margin.

They may have the best service in town, but in terms of value for money they just can't compete with the hundreds of alternative providers for the phone, internet and entertainment.

I think it's quite clear why Telstra would have stopped growing, the market share in all sectors would have absolutely tanked compared to 1999 data.

I'm not sure what has changed in the business sector. Perhaps Telstra are still dominant there. As for the individual consumer, you'd have to have rocks in your head to have any Telstra products."	MeepoXL	0

They got some cheap debt a few years ago and tried to become a ""regional tech giant"" (or some equivalent words) with mixed success.

They should have moved to become an electricity 'generator and retailer', but they turned their backs on that.

The best plan management have ever come up with is to split out an infrastructure company, if that happens it might have some growth potential."	9aaa73f0	0

2020-01-10	18:42:53	"There was a Dot Com tech boom around that time if I remember correctly.

I think that high '99 valuation came from it being a semi-tech company at the time.

Any stock that was even slightly tech related was getting stupidly optimistic valuations.

Either way, Telstra is never going to be  a great company to buy for share price growth.

If you have a company that has a $45 billion market valuation, then to go up 100% in share price you need to double its valuation to be $90 billion.

If you have a company that has a $4.5 million market cap, then to go up 100% in share price you need to double its valuation to be $9 million.

When you are already a dominant player, it is much harder for a large company to add $45 billion to your company's value than a small company finding a niche area to operate and adding $4.5 million to its value.

Telstra is probably better for range trading or dividends because it's never going to be a growth stock."	dzernumbrd	0

But if Telstra float off their 'infraco' (split in two independent companies, retail and infrastructure), they could create an environment where NBNCo could be sold off to someone else, as its more likely to be see as a competitive environment.

That would be good for Telstra/Infraco as they would be able to try and grow infrastructure again by competing against and NBNCo in a less regulated market."	9aaa73f0	0

Telstra's own network covers a large amount of rural and regional areas, but they provide a smaller network to MVNOs (Mobile Network Virtual Operators). In Metro areas and capital cities, you might not notice a difference because they are both using the same towers, but travel away from the cities and they can differ.

2020-01-11	00:48:14	"If you think it's too expensive, park your money somewhere else. The past years gains are not indicative of 2020s gains. Do you really think the share price can increase 45% this year + 5.2% fully franked dividend (assuming no tax) based on a PE of 25 (at least 10% growth)?

Also do you think if the drought continues what kind of effect would this have? If retail sales are down, what kind of effect would this have on their chain stores? If coal/mining/whatever else they do hits the fan, how does this play out? Wouldn't concern yourself about a recession because we're likely all fucked for a while if that happens."	WowVeryJosh	0

Drought doesn’t bother me for Wesfarmers, they sold coles and are very diversified across mining, Bunnings and more. I think their leadership is good and they put a lot of effort into maintaining their investments (including the realisation that Coles profitability is a dead weight)."	HeckingLoveDogs	0
2020-01-11	01:08:03	That’s my feeling, the real question is about whether it’s fine to buy at current levels despite the internet’s advice of buying at a margin of safety lower.	HeckingLoveDogs	0
2020-01-11	01:24:56	"First of all, i'm not sure I really believe in this margin of safety argument.  Look, yes, stocks can go down.  You don't really want to buy at the top.  Having said that, I am pretty sure Buffett and Munger said something like it is better to buy a great business at a good price, than a good business at a great price.   To do this involves risk. Sure Iran could smuggle a dirty nuclear bomb into the US and it go off.  Markets would tank, like seriously down 50% in record number of days.  But with a handful of diversified good businesses, you should recover, and continue to do well over time.  

People who have sat out this market since Trump got elected or even since Euro bond yields went nuts, or when Bondcano was the big thing, or inverted yield curve last year, saying they wanted a margin of safety have missed out on huge gains, growth in profits and dividends, while having their cash in bank accounts earning interest at lower rates than inflation.  This is truly bad for the individual investor and I don't see many youtubers talking about that problem with wealth creation.  It is quite easy to say there is going to be a crash someday. You won't be wrong.  You can say that for the entire bull run and be a hero and be correct, but you have missed out on the gains of the biggest bull market i can think of.

Having said all of this.  If you are young, eg under 50, you are probably better off in growth stocks.  You will likely have a long time to live and can recover from any financial disaster.  You are not going to get rich sitting on a dividend of 5% and profit growth of like 1-2x GDP.  If you are already rich, these stocks are probably good, but i'd still back growth while being young.  Markets have gone up heaps, but you want to find companies that seem to consistently grow in the teens or higher, generally I would favor a low or non existent dividend, low to no debt, and a history of stock buybacks or takeovers when they have cash.  Over long periods of time, you will do much better.  Probably now might not be the exact time to buy, we may be up by the end of the year, but there will be some sell offs, in particular with the threat of Warren and Sanders winning the Democratic Primary."	cambridgespy	0
2020-01-13	23:41:48	That advice only makes sense if you expect there to be a drop at some point around when you are ready to buy.

My only issue with gold is that its like lithium, in the sense that I believe everyone thinks that it will increase over time as oil has to run out at some point, and the world will eventually get into another war at some point. To me this idea leads to everyone and their dog, who has no idea in the sharemarket over saturating the market and therefore already inflating the price of lithium / gold where it is already massively overvalued.

On that basis currently focussing my time on gold - but also happy to consider other metals considered a store of value in tough times. Currently investigating etfs and other mechanisms for precious metals not specific to a single  stock. I spent a month going through gold stocks in detail and realised they are a different beast and outside my comfort zone. So this is more a sector play rather than a specific stock play - although i am yet to invest a single cent so it remains a proposition at this moment.

My view on demand/supply is that this is of little relevance once fear takes over. People look for a safe haven and gold has that reputation."	qxa899	0

This is how they avoid a direct impact on share price.

You could argue that the context of the sale may affect sentiment. An example is when the seller is one of the company founders or directors. It doesn't happen that often though. More commonly, a large institutional buyer or seller would ""reach out"" through an investment bank who would ring around potential counterparties to see if they wanted to do a deal."	ptyson	0

2020-01-08	18:29:29	"OK, that's also fair enough (re gatekeeping & slightly douchey tone of post).   


I see from the comments and downvotes that I really explained my point badly - in hindsight I can see how poorly it came over.   


The point I was trying to get across is that trying to scry deep meaning from the details of individual trades and their timing is something that you're not ever going to get any value out of. You might get it right, you might get it wrong, and you'll never know. You don't really have enough information to know what it means - no one does. Not the instos, not small players, no-one. It's got a bit of a ""tea leaf reading"" feel to it, this messing around with the details of specific trades and their meaning. People do this kind of thing all the time, for sure, but this isn't the type of mental and time effort that's going to lead to better folio returns. There are things you can spend your time on that will make you richer, and a better investor, but this whole area isn't one of them. If you're into it because its interesting - sure, great, I spend a fuckload of time going down crazy rabbit holes personally.   


But the OP originally sounded like he was trying to use this information to do some high-risk trading, on a tiny spec stock, based on trying to deduce what these trades mean. That's not a trading strategy that leads to OP getting richer - in fact probably quite the contrary."	Minimalist12345678	0
2020-01-08	05:42:27	A month or so ago there was a post on this sub Reddit about OPT primed to increase in value, the OP used a throwaway account, it did initially increase but it has since go down. I do wonder sometimes if some of these posts are tactically written to stimulate demand, I noticed Motely Fool write something recently, spruiking. You are asking questions that assist in price and value discovery. I suspect liquidity is drying up, hence the after market trade, recent Motley Fool  article and tactical sub Reddit post spruiking OPT, not to mention gatekeeping replies. I suspect some people want to exit out of their OPT positions and can't attract buyers at the price  they want without trashing OPT market cap.	macdaddy0800	0
2020-01-08	18:05:32	"It's really hard to say. Some fund managers will have restricted mandates that they can only invest in small caps or large caps, so as a company grows in size it can move into the investable universe for some managers but may move out of the universe for other managers.

But hypothetically, when entering a stock some managers may prefer to do it this way in order to take a sizeable position in one hit, others may prefer to remain anonymous so would buy in small parcels over potentially a number of weeks. No right or wrong approach.

In the end this behaviour probably doesn't materially affect the long term price of a company, as institutions are only one of many players in the market. The biggest factors would be company fundamentals (announcements, etc) and market sentiment."	ptyson	0

People get scammed because they're are greedy, want to be deceived or too lazy to do their due diligence.  For more on pump and dump, YouTube should give a good video explanation.

2020-01-07	19:51:45	Chess offers more security/peace of mind that if the broker goes under you don't lose the value of your holdings. That is because they are held under a central body under your HIN (holder identification number). The broker facilitates the transaction, you will get a contract note when you buy/sell and you will also receive via snail mail a chess statement reflecting your holdings on each company that you own shares in share register. IG and stuff hold your shares in custodian because they are an oversea based broker and they do have regulation to safeguards your holding but you never know how safe until you make a claim when **** hits the fan. If your shares are chess sponsored and the broker goes under, you can simply sell your holdings through another broker and sustain no financial loss.	air18	0

Basically, 2nd most powerful/well-known in the country. This event would be like the Eastern block assassinating Eisenhower sometime shortly after WWII.

I was watching the gold price (XAU/USD) a few hours before the killing happened and noticed a significant bump in the price so someone made a few bucks there. Probably when the US informed the Israelis. Also note that a senior Iraqi military commander was killed too but no one even bothers mentioning that. Since he wasn't a target, that's basically murder but hey, no one cares, right?

If Trump's actions on Iran seem out of step with everything else he does on foreign policy (e.g. North Korea) it's pretty much because people like Bibi, Sheldon Adelson and AIPAC own his ass on this one. He does what Israel tells him. Recently he resisted with a strike but this time he folded. I personally think the geriatric casino mogul Adelson wants to see Iran in flames before he dies.

Look up general market information for the sector the company operates in. Legal/competitive/market risks or opportunities. 

Read the periodic reports. Assess after 3 or 6 months if the company delivered on what they promised in prior reports.

Contact management and sus them out. Ask who their competitors are, who their corporate advisors are, what do they see their role in the company as being.

Compare enterprise value to local listed peers.

Understand the companies cashflow and cash balance to identify th best time to buy. Maybe wait for a capital raise prior etc."	webbj	0

2020-01-07	23:12:04	"Firstly, I think you need to be signed into an account to see all the 'straws'. So this is the most recent evaluation put up by the owner of Strawman:

https://strawman.com/member/company/forecasts/aanNmZ3MxNjU0NmRzMTU4NUZVSkhTZDIzNWZnZGpoZGY=/aanNmZ3MxNjU0NmRzM0ZVSkhTZDIzNWZnZGpoZGY=

Firstly on the graph we can see green/red diamonds, these are other people's evaluations on the price. So you can get an idea if more people evaluate a company higher than the current share price. So you can see he values ALC at 15c based off:

906M shares on issue, $17M in FY19 revenue which grew at 30%, therefore in 3 years time with the current revenue growth you would expect $37M. On a Price/Sales ratio of 5 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price%E2%80%93sales_ratio) it comes to 20.4c for 3 years time. Therefore if you discount it by 10% per year, it spits out a price of 15.3c.

You can also check out: https://strawman.com/member/companies/holding
To see the most held stocks by people on the site, so there should be plenty of evaluations amongst them.
Also you can't value all companies the same way, for example the way you evaluate mining companies and Software-as-a-service companies are different."	WowVeryJosh	0
2020-01-07	23:12:15	"**Price–sales ratio**

Price–sales ratio, P/S ratio, or PSR, is a valuation metric for stocks. It is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue in the most recent year; or, equivalently, divide the per-share stock price by the per-share revenue. Also, justified p/s is calculated as (profit margin × payout × (1 + g)/(r − g)).

Unless otherwise stated, P/S is ""trailing twelve months"" (TTM), the reported sales for the four previous quarters, although of course longer time periods can be examined.

2019-12-31	09:51:53	It’s yielding high because of the uncertainty regarding the extent of its legal liability. If they’re hit with a large AUSTRAC fine and subject to further ASIC and ACCC investigations (read: expensive discovery) before being fined by both, then I would expect continued decline in capital value while also cutting the dividend. Factor in economic risks and it’s a very risky play as you have massive exposures to economic downturn and liability for regulatory violations. Risk and reward are intrinsically tied, so the appearance of a great return means there’s generally significant risk, otherwise the opportunity wouldn’t exist.	Echo_Roman	0

everything i buy is based on understanding the business as well as i can - so i do a reasonable amount of research and have mental checklists i look for etc.

JIN I previously owned and sold a few years ago, probably with the attempted move into Germany.  not sure how it ended up on my radar, might have been when I followed Roger Montgomery's site.  

the latest numbers for JIN weren't as good, not massive growth like previous years, i'm still holding a few in the back pocket though.  i really should have reduced at around 20, made a bit of a hash of it in the end and sold lower.  previously banked some at a good price though."	asp7	0

But earnings, aka ""profit per share""... what do you use? Last year's earnings is most common, and that will create a ""trailing p/e"".

But you could use the forward p/e, by using next year's earnings forecast.

Commsec uses a blended formula as the financial year progresses - it mixes the previous year (trailing) p/e with the forecast (forward)  p/e. So on July 30, it will use 11/12ths of the trailing p/e and 1/12th of the forward p/e. On January 1 will use 1/2 of the the trailing and 1/2 of the forward p/e.

You need to dig and find out their profit margins/kg or tonne. And work out current revenue/NPAT, then forecast these numbers for next year on 25-30k tonnes. Always be conservative to protect your ass. Roughly they make 1M NPAT for every 5M revenue.

If it was me I wouldn't be paying over 62c based off current $7M forecasted NPAT. And that's on a PE of 50 which is already high. And to justify that you're expecting 20% average annual earnings growth.
Conservatively? 30 PE = 38c expecting ~15% annual growth

Their performance was *exactly* half a bees dick above the target required for the management to get paid and dilute shareholders. This made ASX curious

They explained that the money they transferred for clients rose, and so revenues generated should rise too, justifying the share price jump and hence bonuses. It took 5 years for client transfers to reach $1.1B, then it jumped to $1.8B in a single month.

They were asked what revenue is generated by those transfers (ie what their pricing structure is). They won't say.

They were asked where the $1.8B number came from, and why it is so radically different from the previous history. They admitted they made it up and it's only an 'estimate'

So they sent 'estimate' data to the market calling it real, resulting in revenues they won't fully disclose, resulting in a very suspicious share price jump, and the end effect is that management get performance bonuses and shareholders lose value. ASX is calling bullshit on the whole thing.

If you own shares and aren't one of the family members on the board, you're fucked. Move on and maybe you'll get something back in a few months - but don't count on it. It's truly shit and you shouldn't get burnt like this on an ASX200 company, but you have been. Sorry for what you're going through - I didn't know they were a scam until all this happened either, but luckily for me they weren't on my buy radar because of their explosive growth. When the ASX called them out they had a MC of >$1B on <$7M revenue and no profit."	algernop3	0

2019-12-03	17:28:48	"tl;dr - version... there isn't one.

This is all anecdotal so treat it as such.

\- Trucks that I load/unload are not even close to full. Most drivers say that they have finished deliveries by mid-morning with only a few pickups in the afternoons. Contrast this to 12-24 months ago and most guys had enough on to keep them driving for the whole day. Trucks carrying freight indicate that people are buying and selling items.

\- I was speaking with the driver of a VERY large packaging company we deal with the other day. He said that the amount of packaging that goes to a certain very large biscuit manufacturer has halved this year.

\- Speaking with the driver of a company that supplies little plastic measuring cups was saying that they are down to 1/3 of the staff they had at the beginning of the year - somewhat reflective of the decrease in demand they have experienced.

\- Speaking with my neighbour who works for a large food manufacturer here in Qld. They reported their worst month of sales back in May this year for nearly 20 years, they haven't recovered to 'normal' or average volumes.

\- The drought is really beginning to take its toll. Protein meals for livestock are very scarce on the ground and are climbing quite a lot in cost. Unless livestock prices increase, most farmers will be forced to once again reduce their herd size. The drought is also constraining irrigation to levels I've never even heard of which will limit the supply of fresh produce. I think food prices will have no other option but to rise over the next 12-18 months leaving less cash for discretionary spending.

\- The mechanic that I take my car to: a) They are not servicing as many new cars as what they were a few years back which indicates that people are holding onto what they have. b) they offer a range of 'Afterpay' type providers which enable people to pay for service/repairs after the time work is performed. People are currently booking up credit on more than one provider.

\- Most businesses I speak to are flat and none are talking about investing in plant expansion or employing people. Every business owner I speak to talks about erratic sales. The environment is very different to that of a few years ago where sales were far more predictable.

\- There are increasing numbers of Lease/Sale signs on commercial real estate which include industrial areas and retail shopping centres.

I think a credit crunch is coming based on my mechanic's feedback. I think the first to feel it real estate wise will be landlords because as a general rule, tenants are less likely to have investments or any financial cushion. If people start pushing their rental payment terms it could devalue property investments through reduced returns.

I think what's propping up the stock market at the moment is the meagre returns on other investments such as property and term deposits. Not to mention compulsory super which funnels absurd amounts of money into the ASX irrespective of what the current economic environment is like.

Where could the upside come from?

QE seems like the only option open to governments who are looking to reduce existing debt burden on a relative level. QE could also flush funds out of conservative investments as investors look to stay ahead of the inflation curve. What I'd be most concerned about is with a flush of cheaply printed money, people getting themselves further into debt which will prove impossible to extricate themselves from."	innatangle	0
