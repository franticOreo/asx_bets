They have more popularity than QuadPay, and have been expanding aggressively since their IPO in 2019. Once their listed on the all ordinaries on 22nd June, their prices will spike.

2020-06-12	20:18:20	"If a company raises money by issuing new shares, it might upset existing shareholders who feel their holding is being diluted. To avoid this, it will give existing shareholders the first right to buy those new shares. 

The process of giving existing shareholders the right to buy those new shares is the Entitlement Offer. I.e. each shareholder has an entitlement to buy some new shares, based on how many shares they currently own. 

Whether it’s worth taking up the entitlement offer depends on what the price is. If it’s significantly lower than what the current market price is then it could be a good deal."	Kitty015	0

I didn't even voice an opinion on the stock in the comment you replied too, I was literally just pointing out that if Regal wanted to they could cash out for a substantial profit.

They purchased it for between 29 - 65 cents a share. You literally have zero inside knowledge or ideas surrounding their trading, for all we know they could be incredibly happy with the profits they have made and be looking to cash out.

Thanks for the explanation. No I didn't include any Dividends, wasn't even aware they had dividends. I will revisit that.

&#x200B;

Why is GEAR better though - from someone in AUsFinance:

They don't operate the same as shares with a margin loan against them. The funds have pretty tight gearing levels which they will maintain. When there is a market downturn, the fund will sell shares to maintain their gearing ratio. The result is they sell your shares at the worst possible time and you won't have the chance to regain your losses when the market bounces back. I learnt this lesson the hard way during the GFC. I thought the gearing ratio was increasing but not a problem because it would bounce back harder when the market turned. Then I discovered that they maintained a mostly fixed gearing ratio and had been selling shares all through the downturn.

&#x200B;

Note: Gear is not better than XJO (ASX 200). If stuff is going backwards get out fast is the message!"	Balland-Cocgoblir	0

2020-06-12	04:31:09	"I believe the dip was those people who were holding this stock from back when it was around the 0.30 to 0.40 mark. Those penny stock traders probably aren’t in it for long term growth. 

In my opinion, this stock is at a transition point. It is going from a penny stock gamble company to a company with serious potential AND locked in business with major players like Samsung for the next year. 

Also world first break through technology patented royalty free. 

A lot of the negativity towards this stock is coming from people who still view it as a penny stock gamble with no future aspirations."	Richard_Fuld_2020	0

In this slump, what do you guys think flight Centre is going to drop to? Is it worth dumping the pissy 115 shares I have and reinvesting the money elsewhere and hopefully buy it back cheaper than I got it (13.98)? 

I'm liking these BNPL shares and would love to get on sezzle before the ship sails on that. Z1P is stressful but I think as a company their whole system is better than Afterpay and it could do great things. 

Broke into Novonix at 1.35 so yeah market close got me a little shaky, but I'm loving it. Been looking into them and it's not like buying in around the dollar mark could be bad at all. All the rumour and speculation around this company, I'm just gonna go with my gut and watch it tomoz and if goes even lower I'll be happy to buy at the low end.

2020-06-11	04:50:15	I wouldn't be putting money in on something as insanely volatile as this if you've just started trading. Look at safer blue chips to learn, research what usually happens at open and why prices open at the price they do. If you learn through safer stocks then you're less likely to lose big and never come back to investing again. NVX could do anything at open tomorrow so idk right now, best thing is to look at the indicative price an hour before and see if the open price is likely to be higher or lower then make your decision. I'd say 10% more is likely to snag it but you could get it and it instantly goes down 25%, I'm just hoping the hype is gonna push it up.	joshdjd27	0

2020-06-11	05:36:04	Every autist here thinks Z1P is the next APT.. but putting the jokes aside for a minute the news about entering US is big & opens up a lot of potential.	cookie-beast	0
2020-06-11	05:33:27	"The BNPL sector is really taking off at the moment. Afterpay went into the US market about 2 years ago and recently posted their updates from that, which have been incredible.

The US retail market is worth something like 5 trillion. It’s a fuck ton bigger than the Aussie market. Zip has recently acquired a US BNPL company called quadpay, this effectively means Zip has bought in entrance into the massive US market. It’s important to note that quadpay has experience in this market, therefore zip isn’t blindly starting from scratch.

Alongside this zip has raised 200m of capital to help with the US transition, so they’re looking to be in a good place.

Although there is risk involved as much as I hate to say it, as no one really knows how well zip will perform in the US market alongside afterpay, especially during a recession. I believe there’s room for both to grow and if zip pulls off some good marketing strategies they’ll be the closest competitor to afterpay.

I personally don’t believe in BNPL long term, for a variety of reasons as well as visa/MasterCard/PayPal could easily wipe out everyone else if they moved into the sector themselves. I’m personally in this medium term."	Jonodav	0
2020-06-11	06:11:47	The big thing pushing Z1P at the moment over the other BNPL's is the fact they credit check their customers. Unlike afterpay where anyone can get an account. That's significant as if the money government (don't give me shit in fucking dumb) we to put tighter restrictions on the BNPL sector one of the first things they would do is enforce credit checks to ensure people who aren't smart with their money aren't given access to what is essentially a loan. This is the main reason I like Z1P because of how impressive it is that they have credit checks yet still have an impressive market share.	joshdjd27	0
2020-06-11	05:37:50	"It’s only an emerging disruptive technology in a bid to steal market share from credit cards and banks. 

The way people around the world are spending is rapidly evolving and people are looking more and more towards options to increase their cashflow and businesses are looking for a way to bring in more customers and increase sales. 

By using a BNPL product such as Z1P (or many others such as Sezzle, Openpay, Splitit or Humm) you are able to purchase the item you wish to buy without having to put down a penny up front. Simply scan your barcode and away you go, paying back a minimum of only $40 a fortnight on purchases of less than $2000 with only a $6 a month account keeping fee. Interest free! 

Did I mention you are able to sign up in only a few minutes with a couple clicks or swipes?

How good is that baby!"	Iracer69	0
2020-06-11	05:38:50	Thanks for your insight, yeah im of the same belief that other companies like PayPal will easily chuck money into BNPL services and wipe out small competition like Z1P, but ill be kicking myself if it jumps and i miss the boat or rocket as this group like to say..	reddit-and-said-it	0
2020-06-11	06:06:27	"Pretty sure visa and MasterCard have already made attempts at getting into the market, but you have to think when most people would go to a checkout online and see some shit like ""visa pay later"", they'll be like oh it's visa I'll just pay with my card.

2020-06-11	06:52:39	You are extremely uninformed.  There was alot of ethical concerns initally against stem cells derived from human embryos. George Bush passed a bill that killed any funding of stem cell research setting it back 8+ years.  It only started picking up steam again during the 2010s.  Alot has happened since then and it's on the verge of breaking through. Two months ago I bought stock of an American company out of Cleveland called Athersys. They use bone marrow derived stem cells and are in late stage clinical trials for treatments of both stroke and ARDs. We should see a promising new industry unfold in the next two years.	yungsta12	0

2020-06-11	03:10:34	There is an index rebalance on Friday, and MSB is currently ranked 145 in terms of market cap on the ASX and has met all the other requirements so it will definitely be added unless they postpone the rebalancing like they did in March. I read that it'll be announced on Friday after close then officially added to the index the friday after	brezzle98	0
2020-06-11	12:30:12	"I did stem cell research around 2013-15. I haven't kept up with the field but back then my impression was that any mainstream medical use of stem cells was around 20 years away. We just can't control them well enough to prevent off-path differentiation at the moment, but there are small steps being made every year. 

I don't think I'd say it's a huge disappointment, I think people just have unrealistic timelines for these things."	swimfast58	0

Covid-19 ARDS will be a label extension. This treatment is already being sold in Japan and has been used thousands of times in compassionate use programs across the world. These stem cells are proven to help with inflammation and ‘cytokine storms’ which is what actually kills you from covid-19. 

MSB already has a number of partners in big pharma including Grünenthal for chronic lower back pain (which hasn’t even been approved yet),  Lonza, Takeda and Tasley which imo is a huge vote of confidence in the actual technology."	brezzle98	0

NVX manufactures the synthetic graphite which are used in creating the ""million mile battery"". CATL (the chinese company Tesla is rumoured to partner with) would use this material to create their batteries. CATL is a customer of NVX. 

This material could also be used in Tesla's gigafactories where they manufacture batteries as well. 

NVX also makes battery testing and research equipment - which both TSLA and CTLA could use

tldr; NVX does not make batteries. NVX would be part of the supply chain for the tesla batteries."		0

It's about to be Summer time here, and a good majority of people are just getting back to a sense of normalcy. Also, as recessions go...it certainly isnt hitting my pockets, or the record number of new investors on Robinhood :eyeroll:.

While SZL certainly isn't as big a name brand as APT, it certainly overshadows names like Z1P or Quadpay for the time being. I think we'll continue to see solid growth, as BNPL as a whole has barely scratched the surface in the US market. 

SPT (which I also own) is actually relatively unheard of (at least in my circles). I think the upside to SPT is it's international appeal. Their deal with Shopify is also a good sign that their merchant population will continue to trend upward in the near term.

Moral of the story- hold on to all BNPL that isn't APT (shit's inflated). MOST Americans don't even have a clue about it yet. This shit will continue to print for a LONG time."	eat2tolift2	0
2020-06-10	00:22:26	"I love SPT but the fact that they require customers to have a credit card makes it hard to scale for them when there's a bunch of research shows that Millennials and Gen Z do not use credit cards, I think number is like \~40% vs \~70% of older gens.

2020-06-10	14:30:43	"In a volatile market, having a leveraged product means that it literally decays. These stocks are straight up not a long-term hold. Here's some maths that helped me understand it: 

>One major factor seen in leveraged ETFs is decay. This decay is a function of the math behind having a multiplier. Let's use the example of two ETFs. The first, ABC, is an ETF that tracks the Big Index. The second, XYZ, is a leveraged ETF that returns 2x the Big Index. Both the ABC and XYZ ETFs start off trading at $10 per share. Day 1, the Big Index is up 25%. The next day, the Big Index drops 20%.  
>  
>After the first day, ABC rallies from $10 to $12.50, up 25% in-step with the Big Index, while XYZ goes from $10 to $15. The second day, ABC shares give back 20% or $2.50 to close back at $10. XYZ, on the other hand, gives up twice the 20% of the Big Index, 40% or $6 to close the day at $9. Even though the Big Index and ABC ETFs are both breakeven from where they started, the leveraged ETF XYZ is down $1, trading below where it started two days before. In terms of leveraged ETFs, **decay** is the loss of performance attributed to the multiplying effect on returns of the underlying index of the leveraged ETFs. In the example, the decay took $1 or 10% off the performance of the leveraged ETF.

2020-06-10	16:16:08	"Thanks for posting that up. I started trading in March and was lucky enough to buy into the market on the 24th March so profited quite well so far. I bought into BBUS 4 times over the past few months trying to average down (but nothing I cant afford to lose). Rather than further averaging down on BBUS, i decided to ""average down"" the loss on my portfolio but pumping more money into stocks like NCM, NAB, SXL, MFG, AIZ which have all performed well for me. I was lucky enough to particapte in a couple of SPP's which further improved the performance of my portfolio.

So now I am stuck with BBUS which makes up about 15% of my portfolio. I thought about selling many times before, but i still thing there is going to be another rout. It might not go back to the March 23 low, but i'm thinking is, if the market starts diving and i dont liquidate out of some of my positions fast enough, BBUS will be a slight hedge against that loss. Yes i understand your points about decay and i shouldnt hold long term. I was also thinking about selling most of my BBUS before 30 June to net off some of the gain's i've made so far.

Not sure if the above makes sense, but i apprecviate you spending the time to look at it."	1odie1	0

2020-06-10	17:04:31	"It does make sense, however losing money to save on tax is not the best idea. That should probably only happen incidentally. 

I would get rid of your BBUS holding, use the money literally anywhere else, and bank on being able to sell faster than your accumulated profits evaporate. That way you'll come out ahead, even if only by a little. This is pretty much my strategy. Do I agree with the markets? Not really. Do I want to make money? Yes. So ride the wave.

Enjoy the ride, you won't get easy gains like this for another decade, second wave crash notwithstanding."	DragginBalls_69	0

2020-06-09	20:04:25	I think their rationale behind not bailing out Virgin would be with the clusterfuck of a shareholder structure. Only 9% of the overall company is controlled by Australian shareholders, the remaining are Virgin Group (10%) and four Asian/ME carriers at 20% each. Would be hard to justify that.	calicotrinket	0
2020-06-09	21:06:33	Virgin is basically a shell company owned by foreign airlines. They could never make up their mind if they were competing with  jetstar or Qantas. In the end, it felt like Jetstar+ but with near Qantas prices. My work let me say who I prefered, I always said Qantas. Qantas as very poorly run at the highest levels, but the day to day stuff was better. Maybe virgin can clean house and come back.	_TheLordOfRuin_	0

Though a real fuck you bailout like AIG can also happen. Where the gov buys all the shares in a capital raising and injects huge capital while wiping out the current shareholders (who in these cases usually are morons for getting the company into this situation, i.e AIG)

2020-06-10	12:16:55	"By the time virgin would shut down and a new airline established (which may be a semi pointless excersize because the free market will go similar to the way it is now), you've just had 2-3 years without a fully operating, competing airline. 

The latest and greatest Indo-malay-uk subsidiary airline is busy running 4 flights a week to major East Coast capital cities (except Perth) , rushing flight attendants through their 2-day scam training, pulling in pilots from the Philippines at 35k a year, and trying to upsell their passengers on napkins and toilet breaks. They slowly break into 5 flights a week, now flying to Gold Coast and Adelaide, and we're all hoping that Air Indomalay's $50 flights from Melbourne to Sydney is keeping Qantas' $700 Perth to Alice Springs flights in check. 

In the mean time, pie face Joyce is suckling on the tit of his precious profits because qantas has gouged the crap out of everyone, domestic tourism has taken the hit flowing into all small businesses who can no longer afford to feed their 3rd property mortgage. Suddenly flying to Bali is the cheapest option again so my hard earned tradie dollars can go to bintangs and the scooter hire shop on Kuta Beach.

Virgin is a fully established, point on point competitor to Qantas. Yes they've obviously run poorly thanks to one unnamed CEO, but given how far they've come and fully integrated they are, the insane number of jobs, economic benefits and overall benefits are huge. If virgin collapses it'll be the same story over and over again... New airline established, they struggle and push to compete with Qantas, they eventually get somewhere and have a fully functioning operation that needs a bit of grease, they'll fall apart and need to start again.

And I'd be very happy for my tax dollars to go toward maintaining 2 competing airlines continuously.

However....

Biggest red flag was future growth and earnings.
From memory they decreased their future prospectus and there were some concerns regarding where the business would go once installations were complete..
They did diversify their business structure which is good and a part of that was being positioned to do maintenance/repair/upgrade works on the systems once installed but it didn’t look like it would cover the whole..

Their core demographic is under 34, unemployment seems to effect a younger demographic here in Australia the most.

2020-06-10	06:00:58	Do you hold any now? If not I wouldn’t wait until their next quarterly as you’ll likely risk paying a lot more per share.  It’s a Finance stock, so similar to the banks is rising slowly every week, as opposed to the rapid jumps the BNPL stocks have recently seen.	GeoSciFi	0

2020-06-10	06:36:27	Because their market share compared to the major banks is low, so their current month on month (percentage wise) growth appears to exceed that of the major banks. Also their reported defaults on loans is very low, so IMO they have better growth potential than the big four.  Same reasons I choose to buy NAB shares, over CBA, last month.

I sold all my qan ones at about .70 profit and probably pulled the trigger a little early on that but I'm happy with how all that went down because I reinvested in construction . FLT was my long term travel sector hustle. Just wish I had of gotten into it when I first looked at it (was around the $10 mark). 

There's potential there. Honestly would hold out on selling. Maybe if the country locks down again, yeah sell, then buy again when it's cheap and start the hustle all over.

Why sell if they're in the green? The question is, do you sell on the first sign of red, or hold on in anticipation of even further price rises.	show_me_your_rocks	0

2020-06-09	18:33:56	I think I’ve just held on to no hope for too long in my stubbornness. Realistically it would be better for me to just cash out now and invest in something long wouldn’t it, I’m thinking Z1P after looking at their business model and growth potential, as well as the hype on this sub lol. The good news is I’m quite young and don’t have that much money, so my original buy was only $500. While a $200 loss isn’t great, it’s not the worst in the grand scheme of things at all.	average_hight_midget	0

2020-06-09	19:28:46	I think this was a genuine pump and dump. It’s IPO was like $.20 a shared it almost tripled to around $.56 in a few days... they literally had done nothing and somehow the market cap almost tripled? Anyway people tried to jump on the gravy train and since then it’s levelling around $.30 cents... my personal view and what the fuck do I know is it is still probably overpriced... medical and bio tech companies are really difficult investments. They take tons of cost and resources to design products. They have to hire the best doctors and engineers etc so their costs are sky high and it can take years to deploy a product there’s so much red tape and every country has approval processes to navigate... its a really confusing and difficult space to invest in... my fav medical business on the ASX  is MVP they actually have an amazing product that works and it’s being licensed all over the world. Literally every month they get a new nation on board and their share-price has basically hovered and yo-yo’d for 4 years... I think the question for AT1 is what are they actually going to do to make the share price go up. If you can’t work it out then what are you holding on for?	Wetrapordie	0

I think as per New Zealands lead, domestic travel will open however we may be a while off international travel... that is a pro as people will be forced to take family holidays within Australia. People with kids and young family’s surely will look to a good old fashion QLD theme park holiday... summer is only 6 months away, considering BALI is probably out of the question for a while and people might be reluctant to go overseas in the short term Gold Coast is the next best thing.... that said the flip side, and I don’t know the answer to this. How much of ALG is reliant on international visitors? Will 6-12 months of no international travel hurt them?... and probably longer term after everyone has their domestic holidays in 2020 will people be looking to go international on 2021? Will they see a spike in domestic travel this year and a lull next year?..... you can also Afterpay dream world admission if they helps	Wetrapordie	0

I honestly believe Z1P's business model makes much more sense and is far superior. It doesnt rely on late fees like APT. If people pay their APT accounts on time they lose out. Not a whole lot of people doing that because they are dumb as hell but i can see exactly that fact leading APT's customers to Z1P after dealing with it a few too many times.

Im aware Z1P still has late fees."	DaNeeDaVeeDoh	0
2020-06-09	01:51:17	"I actually was on Afterpay until talking to a few cousins and the gf, they all find Zip's products to be much better and user friendly for various reasons. The perception of Zip as a ""poor man's Afterpay"" is not relevant and once it fades Zip will definitely re-rate. It is the superior platform and will dominate >$2k transactions while Afterpay sucks up small ticket transactions.

Should note that ZIP used to offer their services on Apple's online store not long ago. That's changed, and it looks like Apple will be coming out with their own financing plans.

2020-06-09	00:48:03	I think SBB was in a group of Chinese companies, like Wonhe Multimedia (WMC) and Traditional Therapy Clinics (TTC). I became aware of the latter, TTC 2 years ago and they came up as extremely suspicious because they had dividend yields higher than their share price and financials that indicated their cash and revenue were multiple times higher than their market cap. Turns out they were all fucking scams. Can't believe stonk exchanges in the West actually trust that shit, especially when its difficult to even pull money out of China to give dividends.

2020-06-10	04:00:12	Yeah, I was suspicious enough not to buy in especially considering they hadn't paid a dividend in the past year. Upon further reading seems many attributed that to difficulty getting RMB (Chinese currency) out of China. But also, its likely that those companies were mostly BS. I tried to find the clinics that TTC claimed to run in China and no one had heard of them. Real dodgy operators on the ASX lol.	Exalted_HC	0

Being constructed from futures or options, you are paying over and over again for time value that you can't get back, the value will decay over time, it will trend to zero until it gets closed down or consolidated so that it can fall more.

In short, unless you pick a significant crash within a few days, you're pretty much guaranteed to lose money. If there is one tomorrow, you will still be down overall, correct?

You're betting against the US federal reserve if you hold this, and no one has ever come out on the right side of that before..

My strategy has been liquifying stocks when i gain 20-50% I then often rebuy them after the hype spike.

I want to get back to 70% cash by september so i can pick up some bargains for long term hold and spend less of my life staring at candle charts and sifting through goat entrails! I will allocate about 10% for *bets*

Im aware that ive been lucky so far and i will likely shift to doing larger trades at smaller margins at hopefully shorter time frames."	Placeboid	0

I see either they collapse (unlikely) or they get the project going (likely) and just make money constantly for ages. They look like they will be a dominant Pumped Hydro company going forward. They just have the problem that they keep wanting to do stuff and buy more companies, when really they should be focussing 100% on getting the pumped hydro over the line financially."	letsburn00	0

Basically says we have invested 25million into this and we think its a goer. Its under ADVENT energy which is unlisted but BPH has a stake, however BPH is under a trading halt right now. So BUY is the only company I know of (could be others) that you can buy into to get access to PEP11 atm. 

http://bphenergy.com.au/portfolio/advent/index.html

Goes into a bit more detail about how much they think is there (a lot) why they think its there (geology bullshit) and that gas is expensive so let us drill and make some money off it. 

https://www.bountyoil.com/projects/exploration/growth/pep-11/

this says BUY has 15% stake in it. 

https://finfeed.com/small-caps/energy/bph-poised-benefit-drilling-baleen-target/

Say in January they asked for NOPTA approval 


I bought into BUY at a cheap price and noticed some sneaky accumulation, the price went up a bunch around the 2nd and 3rd of June and someone bought some hella big chunks. 
Hot copper has some people shilling the shit out of the company and you could be holding this stock for a fucking long time but in my opinion something is happening, shits moving. These guys have been around forever, if they drill 10cents a share is possible if they hit gas it might go higher, they were at 12cents a share in 2011 and just on possibility of drilling and gas they could go there again. If they actually do what they say it could be worth more.


Or it could drill find no gas and thats it worthless stock. 

Its a gamble, i think it will go up. You might think it goes down. If you think it will go down, dont buy, if you think it will go up buy. If you are not sure and you have a bunch of spare cash why not drop 500 or 1000 into buy on the off chance it goes up by 10 times in the next few years? If you are broke I wouldn't recommend it, buy some food you pov cunt."	BigJimBeef	0

2020-06-06	22:34:28	"In order for a company to accelerate growth, it needs additional funding to expand. This is so that they can hire more employees, expand to new locations, improve its product, obtain acquisitions etc. 

That funding can come from either debt, equity or both. This can be used to compound future earnings. Debt is tax deductible, and has a low cost so it's usually always worthwhile. 

So if a company has 'big goals' yet no debt, then you need to do your research."	fahrenheitc	0
2020-06-07	03:35:52	I always saw debt free as a plus, infact it's one of the reasons why I invested in BUY. Care to elaborate some more? I am very curious, especially since i have money in the game.	BigJimBeef	0
2020-06-07	04:54:34	Debt is not inherently bad... debt you can’t repay is bad. But as a tool to grow a business it’s great... As mentioned you can get debt to grow your business fast. If you manage it right the debt matters less and less... look at Afterpay they took out $400 mil in debt and in the same period their revenue jumped 105%... the current business loan rates are probably sub 3% so you’re taking on a small expense to rapidly expand your business... also I’m pretty sure you can write your interest off as a tax deduction... so interest rates are low and tax deductible and you use the debt to grow.... I just read BUY’s quarterly report they have no debt and $1.5 mil in cash which in terms of oil exploration is fuck all.... so for a penny stock, without taking in debt how would they grow their business 10 or 20 times?	Wetrapordie	0
2020-06-07	14:09:28	"I'm not a oil explorer but i would imagine that the fact they have positive cash flow with what they are running shows they know how to run the business without pissing the money away. They could always take on more debt if they need. The main reason I'm invested is because of PEP11, BUY has a 15%free carry and every other avenue to invest in PEP11 is on a trading halt right now. I have heard that NOPTA approval is due soon (soon being within the next 2 months). Now i have also heard news that the government is planning on building a 6billion$ pipeline from WA to the east coast. It would seem to me before they do that it would make sense to fully explore the possibility of gas 50km from Newcastle. 

There is a lot to happen before BUY goes through the roof but lets say NOPTA approval comes though,  they drill and hit gas, they sell it to Sydney. How much is that worth? I can't put a number on it but it's a lot. I got in at BUY at .006 since then I have noticed some very suspicious trading, large numbers of trades going through in clumps, large amounts sold in 1 off clumps and a week or 2 ago the price jumped from .008 to .013 in a day.  It touched .015 but slowly bled out to .012.

Now this suggests to me that something or someone knows something and is accumulating.  I could be wrong but I'm willing to take a risk and so far i have doubled my investment. I'm not going to sell till i hear some bad news or i make bank.

Thanks for the info on debt btw."	BigJimBeef	0
2020-06-07	16:23:48	I haven’t done any DD so I can’t have a crack at assessing the company. I hold ORG shares and am long on LNG so I wish you all the success... generally debt isn’t a bad thing, when interest rates are low and can be written off as a business expense if used right it’s a tool for accelerating growth.... that said too much debt can destroy you in a down turn have a read up on Hetrz in the USA... they are closed to fucked with no customers cause of corona virus and $14 billion they can’t service	Wetrapordie	0

That's just my style of investing though and it's a little old fashioned. 

You could probably find better opportunities to invest if you looked around but BUY has doubled my money so far and I'm happy enough with that."	BigJimBeef	0

I seriously doubt it, but Jpowel may have a tiny grain of respectability and view his role as full employment, not the S&P going up. Now that the unemployment numbers have hit their pre PPP peak, he could start reversing the QE. Though the US is about to have two spikes in their waves, the memorial day spike, then the protest spike."	_TheLordOfRuin_	0

People here talking about the decay, it is 8% over  a tumultuous 5 months, who cares. It’s the 70% drop from my high that was the big kick to the balls.

I stupidly held this from +20% to -50% because i was too stupid to accept how fast the asset inflation would kick in from QE.

I still think a drop will come, but as a comment I read in WSB said, we’ve passed the liquidity crisis, now we need to wait for the insolvency crisis. I can’t see that happening before September at this rate.

I sat on this for ages waiting for it to bounce back a bit, but I realised this is just a slow burn down. Not only have I lost a bunch of capital, it’s caused me to lose the opportunity of big gains on the way back up.

2020-06-05	19:57:41	"I'm not buying them because their products suck. They're cheap, crap, high failure rates, and poor insulation. I bought an inflatable camping mattress and it failed like 4 nights into our hike and went flat. Their repair kit included was junk as well. This is in comparison to say Macpac, which is like 10x better. Slightly costier products like North Face or Columbia are also significantly better in quality for only a minor price increase. I don't care if there is money to be made, Kathmandu can suck a fat one here and I have no intentions of participating in the success of their business.

TLDR: Their stuff sucks and I won't touch the stock."	tatty000	0

There seems to be a stereotypical Chinese money buy yourself a Kathmandu jacket and an amg merc and price everyone out of the housing markets."	auscontract	0

It's a form of symbolic capital. If you can afford it = you join the rich club/bourgeoisie.

2020-06-06	14:54:10	Yeah, I understand the psychology behind someone wanting to buy their overpriced products. In my experience this symbolism also effects really poor people. I have friends who can barely rub two dollars together are drawn to really expensive brands like Kathmandu. As soon as they get paid they spend it on expensive high end clothing brands and electronics. I've got to respect the hustle from these companies, convincing people spend money on their products over people feeding themselves. I'm starting to convince myself into investing into Kathmandu...

Personally, I think that when people go for a particular brand that's beyond their pay grade, it's to do with a certain type of image they want to be seen in; it could be a social class thing, sexual attraction or even an escape from the mundane. 

But yeah, on the advertising bit - Alain De Botton explained it on-point when he said that companies tend to conflate something that people desperately need, with something they don't - so they end up making the association that in order to gain happiness, they need to buy stuff. Take Jeep for example, they take people's need for freedom and adventure, and associate it with their car."	auessant	0

The real question is when, and that's a big question when you're dealing with BBOZ which has volatility decay. Also how much, no one knows if we'll be able to retest the March lows again - we'd have to drop at least 20% again for that to happen."	malbro08	0

This price would give Zip a market cap valuation (back of a napkin calculations here) of nearly $20 billion whilst they have revenues under $100m per year, meaning they would go from a current price to earnings ratio from 2.77x to around 200x

This could eventually hit $60, for sure, but very likely not in a week.

2020-06-05	04:12:38	"IFN - takeover offer posted by UAC in the past few days. With the board responding today noting that it was opportunistic timing and the company was confident of its long term success. 

I think the takeover may happen as UAC bought up 17.1% of the stapled shares Tuesday prior to posting the offer showing commitment to the takeover. However, I think they will have to offer higher. It's a punt as the board has currently not made it's decision. Could be a few tendies there

2020-06-05	17:51:19	Agreed - prob not a quick trade. I purchased on fundamentals after a read of their last investor presentation. Planning to hold. Only 8% of shares are held by retail investors.

As far as I can tell, this gubment will do ANYTHING to stop the middle-upper class from losing money - and we have more welfare programs / safety nets for the lower classes, people on struggle street and the disabled (as well as 🌈🐨) than all of your wives have boyfriends. So thousands. 

I was born after the last recession, but from what I’ve observed the big difference these days is the Internet, and the immediacy of information. How interconnected everything is. I’d like to be proven wrong, I’d like nothing more than to see a lot of rich lazy fuckwits that I know and I’m sure you all know get ass r@ped by their over-leveraged property portfolio (completely shafting my generation in terms of getting into the market), but I agree with Iracer69, this won’t last long.

2020-06-04	17:07:25	They are going to create and sell more shares, adding to the pool of total shares in the market so each share is a smaller proportion of the total company. The problem is that it takes a few days to put the documents together so while they are in trading halt, the BNPL market is booming and they are not trading so buyers may look elsewhere.	bignikaus	0

2020-06-04	16:08:10	Between 10am and 10.10am, all stocks are auctioned. A special average price is determined based on volumes of buy and sell orders to form an opening price. E.g. 1 sell order for 100 units at $0.75, and 1 buy order for 100 units at $1.25, open price should be around $1 with both those traders executing an order at $1 (they both get a better deal than they ordered).	burnttoast1944	0

Aka: the eurodollar market (eurodollars first reffered to USD in europe, but now applies to USD used anywhere in the world not just europe - the name stuck however.... it sounds better than worldUSdollar market anyway)  


  

So all these sovereigns and privates owe a butt load of USD. But where to get USD? There is only one place it comes from, the USA, furthermore, the Fed. So demand is still high.

 

 

Google Brent Johnson, Dollar milkshake theory. 

 

Eventually at some point the demand will drop and/or the world will get pissed enough to the fact that they (the Fed and USA) are gaming the system. But truth be told, everybodies doing it so how pissed can the rest of the world really get?

2020-06-03	23:03:28	but in all seriousness, normally the last price of a share is a reasonable price to bid, but ZIP has been ZIPPING up and is opening higher than that last price due to high demand. If you put in a really high bid (e.g. $8) you'll be almost guaranteed to fill at open at whatever price it opens at (read about pre-market auction).	burnttoast1944	0

Likely tomorrow it will jump up again but there's also a chance it'll settle down and drop in value. You should really know how to handle loosing money before putting money in.

If you put 5 grand in and it looses half its value, and you freakout and sell, you'll guarantee yourself a loss. That moneys gone.

Bid slightly higher 6.4 if you're desperate to get in, guarantees you'll get the stock you want."	LicencedPotato	0

In all seriousness though, would it be fair to assume that there may be a domino effect of retail investors (most of us lezbehonest) pumping the shit out of most if not all BNPL from this point on? 

Interested to hear views on their debts, from those in the know. How the fuck is unemployment so bad / economy contracting / doom and gloom everywhere but these companies are getting paid, successfully.

Seriously though, the average working class American makes just as much (if not more) on unemployment benefits as they do working. Some people, like me, are literally paid a full time salary to do next to nothing (not drawing unemployment).

Before I bought (at 0.57) I did a poll through some of my friends - I told them to ask their wives if they knew what Sezzle was. 6 out of 8 said they had heard of it (didn't ask if they used it).

I've only traded them a couple of times and the last time I kept received error messages for a few hours before I was able to sell. Also if it hits the stop loss, the product is terminated and there's no coming back. This can also be a benefit if you use it for risk management - you know your maximum loss in advance.	NonUser73	0

2020-06-03	02:33:26	"get a commsec account, remember that there are fees to trade, so you don't want to waste all your gains in paying bank fees.

if you have $10k, and say can put $500 a week away, figure out how much you are comfortable of that on high risks and what amount you definitely want to grow over the long term.

so hypothetically you decide to put $9k into long term, low risk, and $1k into short term, high risk.

if that's the case then just plunk your $9k into vanguard, there's a few versions, high growth, australian, international, for your first $9k just pick one save on fees. invest and forget. come back when you're 35 and need a house deposit.

for the remaining $1k, pick a single stock and take a risk, if it goes up, good, but plan what amount you are comfortable to selling at. If a stock goes from $1 to $1.20 over a week or so, you might just agree that the 20% is enough and cash out then. This will effectively turn your $1k into $1100k. 

if the stock turns to shit, cut your losses and recoup some funds, or just set and forget that $1k until you can sell it to break even. 

if you can keep putting $500 a week away, keep $450 for the vanguard and put $50 into your risky tin. Maybe every 2-3 months accumulate and shuffle it across to the vanguard ETFs in bulk so you save on bank fees.

once you've accumulated another $1k for your risky shit (ie 20 weeks of saving, or from your gains), you could bet on two stocks at a time. eventually either though adding $50 a week or through gains, you'll hopefully end up with $5k or $10k, fucking pay your taxes, spend an excess amount and have fun with it. Keep whatever amount you are comfortable gambling with.

don't ever bet more than you're willing to lose. if you have rent due, bills to be paid. NEVER mix this with investing in short term. it's fucked and will ruin your fucking life."	lewkus	0

2020-06-01	23:47:13	"Like most I'd like to say I've saved more, but I've been fairly diligent with bucketing my money etc in the last 5\~10 years.  I find I'm better at picking long term Mid caps (as short investments) that double over a year or so compared to small caps (as short plays) that gain 10-20 % within a week that I can turn a quick profit.  Possibly because I'm more a researcher rather than risk taker, even though that's where the bigger gains can be made.  At this stage I'm not really interested interested in ETF's / Large Caps as I want to hold stocks with potentially better capital growth rather than dividends, although I'll eventually transition to those in a few years.  Anyhow, I was more interested in ""what is everyone else doing"" if you get my drift."	GeoSciFi	0

2020-06-02	01:20:03	"So just today, a study revealed that gambling expenditure increased bigly due to super withdrawals ( https://imgur.com/gallery/AyxiQQF ) the take away is that with all this free money floating around aussies will gamble it.

Furthermore, us sports not announced opening, if they do thats free money in the short term.

Furthermore 2.0, morningstar just upgraded pbh to a price target of 9.55 ( https://imgur.com/gallery/g4dFhOc  ). For comparison morning star has a price target of 29.25 for APT, so despite all time highs we are not overvalued.

Lastly the market depth right now indicates a 6:1 buying pressure of units, hence why its just going up, people that are in dont want to get out. Not yet anyway.

All of this combined with pbh being a new company making huge strides in america and au in such a short amount of time position it to grow into the digital age of gambling very comfortably. Get in whilst the tendies are warm.

DXB. 

Well funded biotech with 2 phase 2 results coming up in June/July. Getting in now is very timely.

As per usual, these things are almost binary in that a failed trial is the end of the game but in this case there are two trials and both have huge market potential - so in the worst case the failing of one isn’t the failing of the other. 

It’s solving quite a specific gap in the market and has proven to be very effective - with significant patients staying on the drug after trial completion.

DYOR but I’m bullish and personally got in at 24c average price and pending good results this thing will ROCKET.

So you sometimes see 'new' tech stocks that have a really old chart because they used the old shell company of 'Western Australia Gold Diggers Incorporated' or something cheaply.	BatFlu	0

Only thing with DDD is the recovery from past owners. Doesn’t matter how much gold you feed into your mill, if you aren’t getting recovery through your CIL circuit and pumping it all out to tails you are wasting money. Only way to combat it is either use more cyanide (extra reagents cost $$) or do lower tonnes which means your through put is down and your weekly pours will be less.. but then again they did say they had multiple companies come in and tell them better recovery methods so who knows."	cameltrowe	0

That and the fact that it is a logistical nightmare to extract eggs during lockdown, add to that the constraint that sperm needs to be collected within 2 hours of extraction... i would say most couples will forgo their cycles up until september at least.

Patients usually follow the doctors, that have known to have good success rates, similar to how partners at law firms leave and start their own firms once they have developed relationships with enough clients. Whilst IVF is more of a 1 off relationship, word of mouth is very strong in that industry.	ho1328	0

I've noticed on days in looking closely that big drops tend to be ""real"" while futures drive big rises, though the rises tend to be from the overnight."	_TheLordOfRuin_	0

May steal BDPE (big dick print energy) and use it as my trading mantra. 

Gonna call it now though,flipping bull late Aug. at 3200-3800. Maybe then the printer will help, not hurt. Would be nice to be a brrrr boi for a change, at the moment only my hedge benefits."	godisaturkeysandwich	0

I also dabble in the US markets, but always lose because I'm never awake and never do any actual DD. I just follow DD posts on WSB or pick something fairly random because it's 5.45am and I'm confused. I lost a bunch on BAC $25 calls the other week - literally had no reason to buy them. I've just (in the last 2 hours) put orders in for calls on 2 random stocks I've never heard of and unless something piques my interest in the next 40 minutes, I'll let them fill."	Ratty-fish	0
2020-05-29	05:17:42	"I’ve played a little bit. But probably not enough to have the best opinion on, regardless here’s what I’ve noticed

It’s nothing like the US market, volatility is low and there’s little volume plus large spreads and large commission costs

Options in Australia are best suited for hedging your stocks, and if you aren’t hedging then you probably won’t profit unless you execute the order, as theta will destroy the value of your option before the price changes significantly enough to be profitable to “sell to close”

Edit: oh yeah I haven’t played with XJO options yet, so that may be a bit different from what I’ve noticed. I hear that the XJO has a much larger volume"	FallenSegull	0
2020-05-29	03:03:06	"Hello I trade Aussie options and I deffinatley exist. I mainly sell options now (burnt every time I try to buy them) and if im being honest its not too bad. It kinda sucks when the spreads are too wide and you just never get filled. Options trades on Directshares are also quite expensive at 31.77 a trade, so good luck trading on a smaller balance. The style is much the same if your talking about just yoloing shit so no big difference there.

I trade options because I like collecting the premiums each week or each month when they turn monthly, either cash covered puts or covered calls when I have the shares. 

I would recomend trading options here, we need a larger market again like in the USA so the more people that are on the better. I have no evidence for this statement but its probably the CFD industry here which is killing options market..."	Then-Treacle	0
2020-05-29	02:55:50	They do exist because there have been heaps of XP’s the last few weeks. They must have been purchased pre corona, in which case seems wildly risky to me. Who here would have bought 2,000 CBA 5/20 $80p in November last year? And if they were purchased after who is selling them with the very real possibility of a massive crash?	BadCompany090909	0
2020-05-29	03:20:31	"The slogan for this place is ""the spreads are wide"". yeah we play them.

&#x200B;

I find there for XJO and ASX20, there is a some amount of liquidity. But you basically need 50% gains to deal with the massive spreads and high brokerage (at least for Commsec).

&#x200B;

I made about $40k in March, then lost about 30k of it being a gay bear (I was throwing away $4k a week in April). Now I buy XjO in $3-400 blocks, waiting for the crash which never comes."	_TheLordOfRuin_	0

2020-05-29	03:33:51	My crystal ball says soon, bear-brother. 5900 is 50% retracement, a perfect dead cat bounce. We hit 5920 or so today before the ever-rigid bull dong went flaccid and we wiped 1% off the board. I expect another couple of tests of the low 5900s before we turn tail and party all the way back to bear town and tendies/tinnies/snags.	godisaturkeysandwich	0

It may be the case where it is potentially much easier to treat the systemic inflammatory response from the virus e.g ARDS, in infected individuals who are unstable then it is coming up with a cure, especially since the virus is not lethal in over 90% of people. The cure to the virus only serves the end of preventing its transmission to at risk individuals.

And its never used. But cashed up people buy a house like this and keep it, or put one in. but they dont use it. so why do they do this? 

\- Its so bizarre, right? Because I agree dumb money loves pools. But I guess if dumb money has more money than most, they go tennis court?

It reminds me of tobacco companies. They paid insanely high profits and dividends, but you needed to look at whether you want to be shackled to a dying industry which profits on doing fucked up stuff.

2020-05-27	19:26:27	" The apostles of ""value investing"" have called the top of the [COVID-19 equity rally](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p54trn). The closely watched [GMO fund](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p54s54) has been liquidating its holdings on US and European sharemarkets and buying hedges at a breakneck pace over recent days, warning clients that the explosive surge in prices since late March has decoupled from fundamentals and is becoming treacherous. ""The huge reversal does not make any sense,"" it said.

The group's main fund has turned outright short, taking large negative positions on equity indices through futures contracts. ""It is going to be very difficult to come out of this pandemic unscathed,"" said Tommy Garvey, GMO's asset strategist. ""We have a pretty strong view that with so much extreme uncertainty, equities should be cheap. Quite simply, they are not. We think the long-term return on US equities is going to be negative and prices will have to drop even below the March lows to be attractive.""

This implies a 30 per cent fall in the S&P 500 index to clear the froth and restore plausible valuations. 

>😫😫😫🌊

Garvey said emerging market equities were closer to fair value with dividend yields near 6.5 per cent. Much of east Asia has overcome the sudden stop from COVID-19 without suffering deep economic damage, thanks to testing and tracking regimes that have put the west to shame. Emerging markets are the only area in the world where GMO still has a net long position.

The group forecasts an annual real return of minus 3.6 per cent on large US companies over the next seven years, as well as gruelling attrition for US and European bonds. It thinks value stocks in developing countries promise annual gains of 10 per cent (share appreciation and dividends together).

The GMO fund, founded by British investor Jeremy Grantham, champions the lost art of disciplined investing, much like [Warren Buffett](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p54wrr)'s Berkshire Hathaway. It delves into corporate entrails - book worth, profit margins and so forth - to identify unloved shares with intrinsic worth. Over time these stocks tend to come back into favour under the iron law of ""mean reversion"".

Grantham rose to stardom with alarm calls before the dotcom bust in 2000 and the Lehman crisis in 2008 but has had a rougher time navigating the quantitative easing era.

Central banks have distorted market signals and played havoc with the concept of equity value.

The post-COVID blitz by the US Federal Reserve - which has increased its balance sheet from $US4 trillion ($6 trillion) to $US7 trillion in just two months - has flooded the system with liquidity, in concert with emergency spending by the US Treasury. This may have masked a lot of sins and played havoc with normal price-to-earnings ratios.

The Fed has torn up the rule book and is buying the debt of ""fallen angels"", BBB companies reduced to junk status. It could at any time go further and start to buy equity index funds and ETFs as well. The Bank of Japan is already doing so.

But the GMO philosophy is that liquidity is mostly short-term market noise. In the end, central banks cannot stop fundamentally insolvent companies from going bankrupt. The bigger the debt bubble, the greater the ultimate damage.

""We are not afraid of being contrarian, but frankly there are a lot of other people expressing concern about the markets,"" said Garvey.

Among them is the hedge fund veteran Stanley Druckenmiller, the partner of George Soros in his assault on the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992. He told the Economic Club of New York this month that Wall Street had lost its moorings. ""The risk-reward for equity is maybe as bad as I've seen it in my career,"" he said.

Marc Ostwald from ADM said corporations had issued $US540 billion of dollar debt in the past two months alone to weather the economic crisis. While zero-rates mean that the money is ""free"" in one sense, the loans still have to be repaid.

The sheer volume of debt has reached such levels that the repayment of principle - now a bigger issue than interest costs - has its own remorseless economic logic. ""This is going to suck the life out of economic growth,"" he said.

Nor is the flow of monetary stimulus continuing at the same torrid pace as in March and April. ""Markets have not yet cottoned on to the deteriorating flows. I am afraid that there is going to be a light bulb moment,"" he said."	burnttoast1944	0

2020-05-27	05:02:44	"Well, the lows that FLT and WEB were based on the worst-case scenario - that pretty much no travel, domestic or international, would be occurring in Australia for the remainder of 2020. This is why both businesses raised enough capital to run on essentially zero income for 12 months.

We now know that this worst-case scenario will probably not occur, since the economy is starting to reopen, domestic borders are starting to come down and, quite importantly, there is serious talk going on about a completely open travel 'bubble' between Australia and New Zealand. And with more than 6 months to go in 2020, we can assume there'll be only better news on the travel front (unless there's a second wave).

Yes, travel has been damaged by coronavirus, but not as damaged as many thought back in March. If you see WEB move to >$5 or FLT move to >$25 (given their shares have been diluted & travel will not be at 2019 demand until there's a vaccine), that's when you can make the justification that either of these businesses are overvalued. Do your own research tho, I might be biased because I have money in WEB rn."	malbro08	0

2020-05-27	05:45:22	"ADNOB like most ASX listed oppies is a call option.

Check the strike price and expiry date. Expiry Date means your oppies will be worthless after that date, so you are either out or have converted them into ADN shares before that.Strike Price is the amount needed to convert an ADNOB into an ADN share.You being in the money depends would mean your buy price + strike price < ADN share price. If not, then you are out of the money.

Be careful with liquidity and volatility in spec oppies like ADNOB, you will get more gains versus ADN but if ADN gets bummed you will lose way more than if you just bought ADN shares. If you have a larger position as well you may find you wont be able to exit at a good price at all because of shit liquidity. However, if ADN is pumping (it is) your liquidity should be ok. Still not as liquid as the underlying stock of course.

That's it for the most part. When it comes to options trading, buying oppies like ADNOB isnt normally what people associate with options trading like in the US r/wallstreetbets. The real ASX options market is very illiquid and you wont find market makers even giving quotes for stocks like ADN, because it is too small."	Exalted_HC	0

$5000 + $19.95 brokerage, puts your buy price +0.4% above the price you set. 

$5000 + $9.50 brokerage puts your buy price +0.19% above the price you set.   

bonus: $1000 + $10.00 brokerage puts your buy price +1.00%!"	Jeologic	0

Edit: I have just received a letter from IVC with Transaction Confirmation Statement and Refund advice.

I saw an increase to my quantity. I didn't receive any specific correspondence confirming how many shares I had been allotted. I did read on the announcements on IVC they were allocating shares in full despite being oversubscribed. So I assumed I would get the full amount. 

Unlike APT that was oversubscribed and couldn't allocate the full amount."	BBBbigbrainboy	0

Apparently the business model is $10 late fee + $7 every 7 days, it'll only charge $10 late fee once for purchases under $40, and for those purchases above $40, the late fee is capped at $68 or 25% value of the purchases, whichever is lower.

2020-05-26	03:47:07	"Almost went for a 28/5 apt call today but that's pure retardism, went for a long CFD instead. 


An interesting stock worth following simply because it's not skyrocketing to several times it's realistic value like everything else is HIT. This is very illiquid, currently only trades about once per day, but look at the dividend payouts over the years and the recent statement that they aren't very affected by covid at all. The dividend yield at current prices is about 5.6% even if they only pay FY 18-19 dividends next year. 6.4% if they pay 19-20FY dividends next year. Even better if they pay more. So that's if the price doesn't fall, but sellers are dumping it presumably for quicker wins on volatile liquid stocks.. If you can pick any up at $1-1.20 you're probably going to end up with 7-8% dividend gross yield.

That's a few-years value hold though, actually quite boring. But I loved my cheque for a few hundred bucks that they sent me recently so I can see where the fucking boomers ruining our lives are getting their jollies now."	BatFlu	0

You can't trade options on the app, but can on the mobile site. Has up to date data, which is free. I usually just add anything I'm interested in trading into the watchlist on the app, it's easy enough to log in for updates throughout the day if required.

The potential risk of being marked as a Pattern Day Trader is that you may not be able to make day trades for a certain period of time (90 days).

Don’t worry, we’ll be building in protections that prevent you from making that 4th day trade in a 5 day period. ""

2020-05-23	22:28:10	"Never short a meme stock. It has everything in it's favour - retard hotcopper jokers, every new retailer who discovered the ASX casino during lockdown, and the CCP all buying as much as they can, all with every unemployed bogan Karen Kmart customer happy to run their husbands credit card through it while they sit at home posting 5g conspiracies and 'just the flu' jpgs on facebook.

With all of that in mind, the quality/moat of the product barely matters. Yes, all the 10 other BNPL companies on the ASX do the same thing, lend irresponsible people money. But how many retailers actually offer any of them except zippay - basically none. They don't need to.

I don't think it's too unthinkable that the CCP will just gradually buy a majority stake and takeover/delist it like they did with Bellamy's. Not like anyone is going to stop them is it?

If I was forced to take a position it would absolutely be long, even if there's another market crash where do you think this is going to be in 2-3 years when it has majorly infiltrated the US/UK markets with 10x more users than Australia could ever have on it's own? The only moat it needs is its brand name - when poor unemployed people have no money and are asking every store 'do you have afterpay', stores are going to get it even if they're paying 6% to get those new sales, because 6% extra expense is better than 0% sales.

If the CCP don't take it over, Paypal are probably going to have to before it affects their bottom line, because paypal's service fucking sucks when you have a problem with them, their disputes are decided by monkeys in the Phillipines or a bot rolling the dice and randomly awarding 1 side of the dispute the money. Sellers hate paypal but until now they've had no alternative that buyers trust.

I hate the stock and it's rabid cult followers because it's always been priced about 3x what it's actual fundamental value is, but don't get in the fucking way, get out of your short while you have money left IMO. Get a margin loan instead of CFDs so that you can actually hold long positions through bad times and top up cash without getting your position closed off automatically, too. CFDs will fuck you up, sooner or later. It's worse if it's later because you get too confident before that point.


Also Monday will probably be a fairly flat opening and then if there's no bad news I would guess after Monday's Memorial Day public holiday in America, when they reopen on Tuesday night they'll be back to buying. Monday could well be a good enough chance to get out.

BNPL already claimed some people's credit scores because they genuinely think they can pay back at any time - apparently a BNPL company in the UK, Klarna had already had 30k people whose credit is fucked out of its 7m customer base.

Ellie Philpott, a 26-year-old from Northamptonshire, ended up £6,300 in debt after she used buy now, pay later loans – though she was not a customer of Klarna – as well as credit cards and store cards.

See one part taken from a newspaper article - it's quite astonishing what kind of things people could sign up to with BNPL.

>“It all started when I was a student. I was offered all sorts of overdrafts, which spiralled into store cards and other loans,” “It got to the point where it was absolutely unfeasible for me to pay it off.”

>Ms Philpott, who works in customer services, said she was encouraged to spend beyond her means. “A large portion of the responsibility lies with me, because I could have had more willpower,” she said. “But I was set up to fail. Every time I got near my credit limit, they would increase it considerably.”

2020-05-23	19:43:10	"Look at the graph, things were semi fucked before Covid, now they are really fucked.

The big thing you need to realise is that a lot of offshore drillers need a fairly high oil price to get new offshore projects. New projects over the long term become field development. If projects can cancelled, it takes years to restart. Cancelling takes 2-3 months, restart take 18.


Lets look at a project I've got no experiance in (so I don't run afoul of and NDA business.) Gorgon, a megaproject LNG in WA. They had the first batch of wells drilled, those are ""new"" wells. This isn't like fracking, you can drill 2 dozen wells and they will produce for a decade. But after the first 5 years, their production drops off. They make less oil and start producing water.

So then the drillers have work. They come in and drill another dozen wells at a billion dollar cost. Those get plugged into the facilities and produce like crazy. Meanwhile the old wells get some modifications (maybe a topside compressor) and they keep producing as they slowly die.

So Covid comes along, what happens? Suddenly they don't need to be at max production, you can let production fall to 80%. So you focus on the cheaper fix, which is extracting stuff from your old wells. No need for new ""top up"" wells and they get pushed out a year.

Now that's everyone. Everyone is pushing out a year. There is work, but it's nowhere near as much as you need. Meanwhile, a lot of the drillers work on a per day basis. When there is high demand, they are charging $2-5m a day (I don't know the real prices). But when there is low demand, they are all desperate to not fire their people who know what they are doing, so they rent out at a loss.

TLDR. Shits fucked. If they don't go bankrupt, they might come back in 1-3 years. If they go belly up, they're fucked."	letsburn00	0

Im not entirely familiar with the terminology used in stock marketing but I'll invest some of my time into studying it. 

by 2k parcel do you mean i should start with atleast 2k to build my portfolio?

and by brokerage are you talking about the cost of having a broker? if so am I able to trade without having a broker?"	Beedrick	0

2020-05-24	01:24:04	"By $2k parcel I mean that's the size trade you should really be making at a minimum. Technically the minimum is $500 or 600 but the brokerage fee is a fixed amount so you're paying a higher percentage of your money as a result if you play with small amounts. So you'd really want probably at least $8k of capital if you expected to be trading/investing in say 4 companies at any given time. Or just stick to 1 position at a time in which case I still say $2k.

You have to use a broker and the brokerage fee is what you pay when you buy, and again when you sell.

So say you buy $2k of shares and sell them for $2200 some time later. You're paying 2x $9.50 = $19 overall. Less than 1% there. But on a $600 parcel that's 3.1% in costs so even if the shares went up 3.1% you're only breaking even.

If you want to go the simple and low $ amount option, look into Commsec pocket. This has a very limited range of ETFs to buy, including NDQ (Nasdaq index) if you want to go for American tech company gains for example, but the brokerage is very low, $2. So with that you could actually spend $200-500 at a time and be paying 1% or less in brokerage. No harm in starting there but you can't really 'trade' it like people here who are buying and selling on the same day or next day. You'd just buy to hold for months or preferably years."	BatFlu	0

I believe the Thatcher administration's worst mistake was to hand HK to the CCP. I can understand their idea of opening up China then, unfortunately those who escaped China during the Cultural Revolution or those from Taiwan will have (rightfully) pointed out that the CCP gives no fucks, they've always intended on breaking the Basic Law the moment the handover was announced, and they've shown their colours in 2014."	calicotrinket	0

Imagine that, you save for years and have money in your bank account. Instead of earning interest on it the bank charges you to keep your money in there.

Negative interest rates penalises savers.  Savers get charged for having money in the bank, so you can't borrow it and then put it in a bank account and let it sit there.  The point of negative interest rates is to force the consumer to spend rather than keep it in the bank and lose money.

I have since watched CAN go to $1.00 and BBOZ to $10.50.

My logic is that black market weed will likely be cheaper initially for some time. The biggest change that will happen when it's legalised will be improvement of the general sentiment towards it so I think doctors will become a lot more comfortable prescribing it.

If you think CBD oils are going to be able to be accessed easier by changes of legislation in addition to current trends of parabolic growth quarter on quarter then theres a few stocks for you.(Not mentioning IP and trial stuff at all so no BOT)

**AGH**, Market Leader in patients and sales. High cash burn, they are scaling unprofitably as well. Partnered with Cannvalate (largest distributor AUS) and moving into UK and Germany markets. Have enough cash to last a while.

**IHL**, New player, also partnered with Cannvalate and the latter is No.1 shareholder in IHL. Sourced 1K patients in 3 months, first sales last quarter. Growth rate strong, no high cash burn. Cash balance is solid lasting another year, no fear of CR.

**BDA**, Solid growth in sales and patients, cash burn is bad but saved by government R&D. Solid cash balance lasting 2 years, no fear of CR.

**MXC**, Diluted to oblivion, lifestyle directors salaries, many MOUs barely any revenues to match the amount of deals they claim, meme-tier. Every spike gets smashed.

**ZLD**, Big suite of products, first revs ever this quarter. High cash burn, only 3 quarters left of cash. CR risk is there.

**AC8**, Excellent cash position so no fear of CR but no revenue so far. They have a product iirc that they want to sell soon.

I dont know much about the rest, besides BOT but BOT is solely a biotech company and doesnt sell anything. I hope this sector gets some love again this year, but so far no dice. Good luck all."	Exalted_HC	0

In the USA they treat it as a supplement, so no FDA approval needed.It should be the same here, no TGA approval needed for fish oil other vitamins etc.

Also, CBD is already legalised. You can get doctors prescription for CBD. Unfortunately it's incredibly difficult to get.

2020-05-22	02:42:57	"The trouble with an underlying good/upcoming idea is that it needs good management to get anywhere as an actual company. 

...Micro cap weed stocks don't really attract the top tier talent, from what I can tell.

I was hyped about MMJ back in the day. 

The management basically turned it from an almost-promising producer, into giving their mates interest free loans from the company coffers, then capital raising (wow I wonder why we are out of cash guys?), then restructuring the business to be a LIC owning illiquid unlisted other weed stocks rather than being a producer. Basically, they buy other shitty weed companies that their mates probably own, and pay themselves a salary to do that out of shareholder cash. Does that sound like a winning idea? 

The market has so little faith in it (or the ability to actually ever see a return from the other companies it owns) that it trades at a massive discount to it's book value. Well done boys on taking it from whatever the listing price was several years ago (20c?), pumping it as high as 83c, and then gradually whittling it away to as low as 6.5c after multiple capital raisings.

I'd imagine the other listed ones aren't overly confidence inspiring either. They wouldn't list on the ASX if they were, they'd list in a country where the product is legal. Our stock market just has really low standards about who can list on it."	BatFlu	0

I do see a lot of benefit in medicinal use though. Personally I don't like the trippy effects of blackmarket stuff. I had the worst experience of my life with edibles before where I thought I was going to die,  my heart rate was beating out of my chest and for some reason I was paranoid I had brain damaged my friend, who also being way too high was talking gibberish. At least I thought she was.

2020-05-20	23:59:43	"Do your own research but SPT (Splitit payments) just broke out and it's the only buy now pay later stock that hasn't had a +30% or more run yet. So even though today was pretty big at +9%, it is still less than half the price it was at it's peak, and with stuff like APT looking very expensive, it probably has more short term trading potential. Target say 65 cents?

I don't hold, cos I was in too many other positions to have any cash spare.


OSH for an oil play without the bullshit decay of OOO, if you buy somewhere around the current price and if it goes below 3.10, get out. Sell target, $4.90 to approximately close the gap.

I do hold OSH.



CAT - its heading up with very high volume today, and with a lot of headroom compared to old prices.

Don't get too focused on the fundamentals if you're technical/YOLO trading as its more about where people can put their money because a news report was slightly positive, than anything resembling fair valuations at this time.

I hold CAT. Not sure on a sell target, probably $1.65.


If I can be bothered understanding imgur or any other upload site I'll post my actual charts at some stage as I know the above is really vague and concerning if you think that's all there is to my analysis. But its the end of a long day.



Also for a bonus super-spec mega gamble, there's TTM (Titan Minerals). This has woken up recently with big volumes going through, they are currently drilling so announcements can presumably come any time from now - you can either pre-emptively sell before they come out if the price has already spiked a lot, or hope that they discover a 500kg gold nugget or some shit. I hold since 0.076. Not sure where I'll sell but if I can get 20c that's only where it was at the start of the year before it got dumped off."	BatFlu	0

In the aged care sector they are making pretty big moves. 

They take a very short video of your face and determine if you are in pain and what may be causing it. They have pretty much covered Australia with this and have a massive grant to get it into all aged care facilities. Once they get used to using it these aged care facilities will most likely continue to subscribe particularly because there was a huge thing about pain in the aged care royal commission. 

They have patents all over the world and are moving in to monitoring pain in babies. Seems like a large market."	SNG_Consultants	0

2020-05-21	07:19:55	"A couple of points.

**Cheap as fuck**

By every metric TWE is very cheap right now.
It's trading well below it's  1Y forward PE and massive discount on average premium relative to vs ASX200 industrials ex financials

**China**

However, this was mostly driven by pretty much the collapse of wine exports to china. March Wine exports to china were down 44%. If we use this a proxy for TWE, this would give us a rough estimation to how much their exports to china were down (although probably slightly less since high end wine demand is still strong).
Now, China was experiencing the brunt of Corona in Jan and Feb so it took 1 to 1.5 months for exports to be hit. Once they ran out of wine supplies it seems ordering had stopped which led to a 1.5 month lag time for exports. As the situation in china returns to normal,I think we can expect a rapid rise in wine exports leading up to 2H 2020. July - December is peak wine export season in with supplies running low I reckon China will be trying to refill shit ASAP.

With this in mind im quite bullish about exports to China (despite the trade war) China loves it's high end aus wine and the trade war will fuck with rich chinese people so the CCP would never do that.


**Risks**

Now for me, the risk comes from the US.
US is currently a shit show atm with Corona and no recovery in sight. In addition, there is non trivial increasing price pressure from other wines in all segments which has caused TWE to loose out on YoY market share.

This is a major concern for me because the US accounts for roughly 1/2 - 1/3 of TWE revenue. 

Now with that being said, TWE was trading at $17 before Rona and now sitting at < 10. 
I am confident that China sales will return to normal in the coming months which will boost price to around $12-$13 but with the issues going on in the US i don't see them getting back to $17.

**TL;DR**

I reckon TWE has an easy 20-30% profit on the table"	FlimsyDrawing9	0

2020-05-21	00:41:47	Good point, that I've definitely overlooked in my post. We'll see what eventuates on that front, but I think TWE are in a good enough financial position to weather anything in the short-mid term. I don't really know though so it's definitely risky.	DragginBalls_69	0

According to Josephus’ account in The Wars of the Jews, a Roman soldier bared his rear to an audience of Jews celebrating Passover, and thereby incited a furious riot that killed “upwards of thirty thousand.” However, a closer examination of Josephus’s account shows that the soldier was not mooning the crowd, but rather farting in their general direction. "	Placeboid	0

More people buying things with afterpay means more fees. They take a (chunky sometimes) commission on each sale. Combined with late fees; there is a good amount of income to write off bad debt. Afterpay is everywhere; prefered over visa/paypal on ebay.

Afterpay is the only line of credit many people (who are now jobless and credit card-less) have.

Under Trump everyone knows anything goes, so there is so much less risk than there will be under Biden who will presumably depart from the current cowboy financial system/inappropriate government loan schemes. 

I think Biden will likely lose as he is another Hillary. He is a safe democract that the people don't really care. He won't get a default black vote just because he was Obamas VP and I think that was a dumb miscalculation. 

They should have given Bernie a go. He was inspiring. 

From what I see outside of reddit, average americans actually seem to like Trump. I don't think reddit is a good view of politics as there are so many europeans/non americans weighing in. Even I can't help but upvote and downvote U.S politics posts so that would hugely skew things in a left leaning way as their left is still very much our right."	PMmeblandHaikus	0

Markets hate unpredictability during a crisis and Trump is bringing plenty of that to the table right now.

The South Carolina Democratic primary would like a word.

>From what I see outside of reddit, average americans actually seem to like Trump.

I would have agreed with you had major public opinion not swung so hard against him this year. Yes, I'm talking about polls.

2020-05-19	21:16:27	one of the best options is Stake, commission free for US stocks, small spot FX fee when you fund your account but great simple platform for trading US stonks - you can use my ref link and we both get a free stock when you sign up [LINK](https://hellostake.com/referral-program?referrer=khalili362)	ball_sweat	0

2020-05-20	20:05:46	I have both, got stake then realised no options and got tasty works. Stake is simple and missing lots of features, good for buying and holding. Tastyworks has an amazing feature set, the interface is over complicated but once you learn it its good. Overall i like tasty works better probably bc my fb fd’s are printing. I’m only doing small trades on tastyworks just to join the wsb club don’t mind if i lose it.	eyedea_ability	0

2020-05-18	22:27:05	I'm willing to take the gamble, Mesoblast has a diverse enough product spread apart from the Covid19 trial that might make it a decent long term hold. So I think I'm going to buy in tomorrow (hopefully it drops slightly after today's insane rise, $4.00 seems like a good price to buy in). Idealy its a short term hold but I wouldn't mind riding out the shit storm if the share price tanks due to the trials not suceeding.	wowstoplookingatme	0

Furthermore they are getting access to more and more states in the US and thus larger reach. Also being new means they have been able to develop their frame work on the newest programming technology.

Read all this shit, inc the pdf and excel docs.

https://www.asx.com.au/products/equity-options/market-making.htm

You will also have to ""negotiate"" with them, that is, start your bid at the midpoint in their spread and slowly go towards them. They'll bite somewhere so don't pay the full spread, esp on ASX20 or XJO.

Also, put in your spreads in one go, don't leg it in, you'll get a better deal that way as well.

Also, don't fucking day trade Australian options, you'll get arse raped. Only longer term shit. Like no more than 2 trades a month on the same option (ie. write 1 month before, buy back near/on expiry day if your into selling theta or similar shit) or a bunch of puts a few months out as a hedge and let the cunts expire."	mytwocents8	0

2020-05-18	20:17:21	"Yeah, all sorts of reasons (bookies, not CFD providers).

Usual shit. I used bookies to arbitrage or create a book with sports, used their free bets, mainly in combination with Betfair.

Most don't give a real reason, they just say their terms and conditions allow them to withdraw service to anyone. They want mug punters, not people with a clue. If you only bet on one sport or whatever, they don't like it. They want people that will bet cluelessly on 2 flies climbing a wall.

I never got into CFD providers because they were just bookies.

I had a friend banned because he had ""too much money in his account"". CFD providers make money on tight guaranteed stop losses or margin calls on really tight gearing (90%+).

Having too much money annoys them as they'll never win as you'll never be stopped out.

This is also why options are so much better than CFDs/Futures etc.

Vanilla European/American Options live till expiry date, regardless of the stock price. If you had bought a Dec call option with a strike of 20, the underlying stock price can start at 22, go to 15 and then go back up to 30. As long as it is before December, the option is always ""alive"", even though it would be worth close to nothing when it is under 19 or so. But it is still alive.

CFDs etc, you would have margin calls galore/stop-loss that you would lose your investment (or more) when it hits it.

Take MQG for example. I reckon by the time this bullshit is done and MQG recovers back up to $150 by December 2021. Like fucking 19 months away.

There's juicy shit around that suits my opinion, like MQG2V9, Dec 21 112 Call for $10.

Do I want to get a CFD, get fucked around, pay a fuckload of interest (prob $10-20 worth), worry about being stopped out and even when I'm fronting $10-$20 per share anyway. And If goes down to 80 or so anytime in the 19 months I'm in a world of shit and either lose it or have to front up with more fucking cash.

Or do I just fucking buy that Dec 21 112 Call for $10 and just wait and see and not be forced to do shit nor cost another cent extra.

So Dec 21 shows up -

CFD option, Pay $20 upfront, $20 or so of overnight interest, can't sleep at night due to thinking about stops, get some pocket change back in divs. Prob cost me $30-40 to make $50 or under 125-150%. 

Call Option, Pay $10, don't give a fuck what happens, could be fucking stoned on a desert island or in a coma, wake up Dec 21, $150-$112-$10, make $28 nearly 300%. 

I know which cunt I'd rather be."	mytwocents8	0
2020-05-18	20:37:40	"And if it gets there sooner I'll make more, depending on how soon, possibly even an extra $10-$20. so 350-400% if it happens 6 months (ie. 12 months time) earlier, 400-500% (ie. worth $40-$50) if it happens in 6 months time from now. 

In-the-Money option, fuck you, pay me.

Using the ""four percent rule"" this means at age 40 you can live off 24k per year. If you live in a country Australian town such as Bairnsdale or Minyip then you can easily live off 24k per year. To mix it up a little, go to Southeast Asia eg Bali, Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phnom Pehn and 24k per year will give you a nice comfortable life, maybe even luxury. There are also many nice islands and beaches in Southeast Asia where you can spend the rest of your life reading books by the beach eg Koh Phangan, Koh Rong, Lombok, etc."	tramselbiso	0

2020-05-16	17:42:52	Another recommendation is to rent rather than buy. Keep your money in  well diversified ETFs instead. If you go to eg Chiang Mai and buy a property there, after one year you may find you don't like it eg the traffic might be too much for you. If you own a house there, it can take a long time to get your money out. After taxes and agent commission, you may lose a significant amount of money. If you rent, you just pack your bags and fly out. Renting gives you the ability to try out different places. The world is your oyster. You don't need to settle or commit to any one place, especially not places with overpriced property such as Sydney or Melbourne. Always be flexible.	tramselbiso	0

&#x200B;

Apparently it's becoming more and more a political view, the detachment from reality is becoming stronger. Was this a fire that got extinguished after still killing 100k, or was it a big scam where people yelled fire because they burned their food and really it was nothing? It looking like the Dem states will push hard to get the death toll down (i.e take a 15% economic hit to prevent a 30% hit), then the Trump states will turn around and wonder why their grandma died (and take a 30% hit).

&#x200B;

I feel like now that the Dems have put forward their stim bill, it will be in contrast to anything the republicans put forward. Though it's fairly clear that McConnell will fight the push to make the life of the poor easier. I did expect the news of the cruise ship bailout to get people riled up, but nothing happened. Trump will probably win election, if he doesn't. The PPT may do a nero order and the market crashes."	_TheLordOfRuin_	0

That said, in this long sideways, but you feel they are going to go down eventually, this is the thing. Also, Citi do not market make on  alot of their products. You can close out, but new positions are super hard to get since they won't sell them to you."	letsburn00	0

2020-05-16	14:39:45	That's like a stop loss. The knockout is usually about 25% of your investment so if the value drops to that, you get stopped out and the product is gone. If you would like to then purchase another one, there will be other/newer products with different strike prices. It's like saying once an option contract expires in May it's gone forever. It is a similar concept, if you're right you'll be in the green, if market goes against your product you lose money.	CommentForGold	0
2020-05-16	14:34:47	"So lets say we are shorting asx200/SP500 (keep in mind that it's the futures that we are shorting).  
Load up the list of products, one useful thing to do is to search each one of them with the broker and see if there's market maker. Citi act as market maker for liquidity only in some of the products, I suspect they stop doing that for the older products as they want to phase it out. For the older products if you do own some. I typically buy products with market makers as it's easier to sell out of. Otherwise another way to sell out of if you own a product is to call a number on the PDS, they will lock in the current price at the time of the call for you and give you a code. You fill out a form and provide the code and they will convert your product into cash for you."	CommentForGold	0

2020-05-17	01:22:44	how the fuck.. so what the fuck is a mini anyway?	Koreanwedding89	0
2020-05-17	17:08:16	"QAN is $3.35 right now. Lets say if you purchase QANKOD, it will cost you $0.61-$0.62.

The product has some leverage to it and for each unit of QANKOD, the leverage is $2.74. So you essentially borrow $2.74 and combine it with your investment of $0.61 to get $3.35 to get a product that mimic QAN. 

There is a stop loss at $3.15 with this product so if QAN share hits $3.15 this product will liquidate. When this happens you will get back $3.15 less $2.74 that you owe, which is $0.41, resulting in a loss of about 33%. So if Qantas drops 6%, the product will be liquidated and discontinue, you lose 33%. On the other hand if QAN goes up about 6%, you'll make roughly 30-33%."	CommentForGold	0
2020-05-17	01:34:10	A mini is 1/100 in value. For example XJO is $5400, an XJO mini is $54. Much more flexibility with the amount you can purchase.	CommentForGold	0

Sorry but what do you mean by ""financing of the drug""  


Apparently MSB reported some good preliminary test results but the test cohort was so small as to be statistically non-significant. Realistically, they ran a proof of concept trial and got favourable results. Plenty of companies have achieved this and I only think their stock has risen so high because MSB is realistically the only company on the ASX working towards some sort of treatment for COVID. They have potential but they are very far from any end play."		0

2020-05-13	21:55:03	"  

Stan Druckenmiller said the risk-reward calculation for equities is the worst he’s seen in his career, and that the government stimulus programs won’t be enough to overcome real world economic problems.

“The consensus out there seems to be: ‘Don’t worry, the Fed has your back,’” said Druckenmiller on Tuesday during a webcast held by The Economic Club of New York. “There’s only one problem with that: our analysis says it’s not true.”

While traders think there is “massive” liquidity and that the stimulus programs are big enough to solve the problems facing the U.S., the economic effects of the coronavirus are likely to be long lasting and will lead to a slew of bankruptcies, he said.

“I pray I’m wrong on this, but I just think that the V-out is a fantasy,” the legendary hedge fund manager said, referring to a V-shaped recovery.

Druckenmiller’s remarks are among the strongest comments yet by a Wall Street heavyweight on the bleak outlook facing the U.S. They also stand in contrast to the optimism that has pushed the S&P 500 Index to rally almost 30% since its March low even as the pandemic has brought the economy to a standstill, seized up credit markets and ended the longest bull market in history.

The damage spurred the Federal Reserve to unveil a raft of emergency lending programs and Congress to unleash almost [$3 trillion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-04/here-s-who-s-keeping-a-watch-on-trillions-in-coronavirus-aid) in stimulus funds. But those programs aren’t likely to spur future economic growth, Druckenmiller said.

“It was basically a combination of transfer payments to individuals, basically paying them more not to work than to work,” he said. “And in addition to that, it was a bunch of payments to zombie companies to keep them alive.”

Druckenmiller said he thinks that the current liquidity will soon shrink as U.S. Treasury borrowing crowds out the private economy and even overwhelms Fed purchases.

Druckenmiller, 66, the former chief strategist for George Soros, converted his hedge fund into [Duquesne Family Office](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0850499D:US) in 2010. His long-term track record, making returns of about 30% a year over three decades, established him as one of the world’s top money mangers. He has an estimated net worth of $5.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Like other investors and Wall Street executives, Druckenmiller agrees that the pandemic will lead to more regulation and higher taxes.

&#x200B;

 

Other highlights from the Druckenmiller interview:

* In the future, he said he wouldn’t be surprised if the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak becomes the “poster child for the worst public policy decisions ever made from a cost-benefit analysis.”
* On a relative basis, he’s as bullish on long-short strategies as he’s been in 10 years. “That’s partly because I’m worried about everything else,” he said.
* Druckenmiller was also bullish on Amazon.com Inc., saying people should be thankful that the company exists right now given the number of jobs created. He also praised its transition to less profitable, essential-needs products without raising prices."	1stPostISwear	0

2020-06-06	06:12:21	Jesus dude. You’re so hung up on this ‘ the  market is Efficient therefore investors are justified in all their buying’ that you’re missing my entire point. Yes they are paying what appears to be a fair market price for an asset today, but what I (and a lot of people) feel is that assets are inflated. They will deflate. You are thinking on a 6 month timeframe, Were thinking on a 100 year timeframe. The covid dip was meaningless ( and yes I played it, I got nice profits and the airlines and mining). How many of your PhD finance friends saw 2008 coming? How many of them saw the tech bubble burst coming? Personal and cooperate debt has never been higher. Houses have never cost more compared to the average salary. P/E ratios are through the roof. The wealth gap is fucking massive. Immigration has come to a stop. Wages stagnant. Interest rates nearly 0. Money being printed and handed out unconditionally just to barley hit 1 or 2% inflation targets. Governments are somehow finding new polices every month to prop up asset prices. Dude, use your PhDs to put this puzzle together. Hint : deflation is coming. 80% of your wealth is at risk.	anonymousoctopus777	0

2. What is wrong with debt? 

3. P/E ratios are only applicable to value investments. A lot of the companies today (think the big tech companies) that make up most of the market cap are not value companies, they are growth companies and their valuations must be thought of as a real option, not through discounted cash flow valuation. Therefore P/E ratios are useless for high growth companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Zoom, Uber, etc: 

https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/valuing-high-tech-companies

4. Wealth gap literally means nothing when it comes to market prices, long term economic growth does not correlate to market growth:

Such a drop is known as a crash or a bubble burst. In an economic bubble, prices can fluctuate erratically and become impossible to predict from supply and demand alone.”

Sorry if i insulted you riding your tall horse on top of your fucking ivory tower with my plebeian investment of 3k. I am only trading with money I am prepared to lose. Right now that is not much more then 3k. So if i appalled you with my measly little trade you can huff until your monocle falls into your deconstructed Chai-latte with coconut milk and talk to your friends at the country club about how the peasants grub about in the dirt instead of tickling daddies balls for money. 

Fuck off back to Prahran or Kew, I am out 2 jobs and I am getting no fucking government support for either of them. I would love to hear your sage investment advice about how to turn 1million dollars into 500 thousand dollars but for now I am just trying to make a little on the stock market to keep me entertained till i can go back to work.

If you want to make YOLO money with $1k you either need to buy a cash flow positive, high revenue earning penny stock that's heavily undervalued and sitting around $1m market cap (..like IGN) and hope to multibag 3-20x in the next 1-2 weeks when the market finally discovers it.

Or you go into derivatives like options and buy puts/calls that are out of the money so you multibag. If you get $32 puts that expire in 2 weeks for APT and it gets to $30, you'll probably end up making 7-9x.

2020-05-11	23:06:16	"You make me laugh mate. You think government money is gonna make everyone just spend a lot more than they used to (back in January) when there's the fear of the virus, uncertainty over incomes and social distancing still being enforced. People are just gonna keep buying clothes from Kmart when all the parties and clubs are cancelled, and even going to a restaurant is a maybe because they can only let 10 people in at a time. People gonna be signing up to Afterpay left, right and centre when their job is at their most uncertain now more than ever, aren't they?

Enjoy rolling around in money when APT hits $100 per share in a few months time. My mistake for not reading documentation about APT's growth being over 100%.

2020-05-11	18:56:13	I brought at $.79 cents like a week ago! After someone on here said they would shoot up. Already 23% up... I’m going to just hazard a guess that some of the state governments have eased restrictions around getting out and about... our door gatherings of 10 people. Some national parks are open for camping. Maybe with no international travel or anything people are banking on hiking/camping holidays coming back this year... Kathmandu also own ripcurl so get upside on that beach/surf market... with the only holidays on offer being within Australia for at least the rest of the year could be more camping and our doorsy type holidays for people 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️	Wetrapordie	0

People are forthing to get out and about after lock downs in the middle of winter.... also KMD are doing massive end of year sales which will probably push their numbers up before end of year. That coupled with their announcement around online sales growth... im personally holding until their end of year results come up. I’m Banking on big sales numbers to drive home another jump... they were trading close to $2.50 pre covid market crash... if they deliver stellar sales numbers could see them push $2 before the end of the year... that’s my view $2 post end of year announcement that’s my personal sale price... do your own DD	Wetrapordie	0

I expect their earning take a hit due to drop in activity. But has anyone read their balance sheet or smth? Where do they make their billions from?

That's in stark contract to Macquarie who have a far more diverse business offering involving larger trading arms and investment banking.

Anecdotally, my opinion is that the big 4 are balls deep in property, whereas Macquarie have a more diverse operation. Also anecdotal, but Macquarie has a higher standard (smarter people)."	warthogdog	0

I'm optimistic that recession pt 2: electric boogaloo could kick off this week if we see another 5% drop earlier than Thursday. The last few big moves down were right before the market closed over weekends, giving the boomers at ausfinance a chance to calm those trembling paper hands down for a few days and reassess.

FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

•	⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors,
•	⁠Spreading incorrect information,
•	⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with an /s.

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

* Lower fees than Commsec.
* Information and research is not as good as Commsec.
* 20 minute delayed market data unless you're willing to pay, or make a lot of trades in one month. Commsec has current (but not dynamic) market data for free as I understand.
* Interface for placing orders is much better than Commsec, especially for amending orders.
* Requires all funds to be in the cash account before you order - with Commsec you can order from the cash account or a linked bank account, and you only have to make funds available the next day.

Rules| Purpose
---|---
1. All money must stay in the game| This prevents weaklings from pocketing returns and claiming the win
2. Any amount is fine| If someone wants to take a bet with more money to reduce the trade costs that's a bet and part of the spirit
3. Trades must be readily available to everyone| Trying to capture as many people as possible in this insider trading scheme
4. Game starts Monday and finishes Saturday| Allows for degenerates to sober up from their losses to post on the thread/imgur on the Sunday



How it's Run| Explanation
---|---
Season will be 8-12 weeks| Gotta give people time to lose everything and declare a no-contest
Every 4 weeks there will be a mini champ | Encourage the masses with a gold star
Every thread will post previous top 5/10 | See above


No idea what the prize would be but I think there probably should be one, since it's free entry maybe something the mods can give them saying ""2020 Champion Season X"" down to 3rd or 4th place.

The long term impacts on the U.S tourism, events and education industry will be massive. States like California which have Las Vegas built on tourism and events, are going to feel a world of hurt.

If we need to wait for a vaccine, that will still take another 6 months to 2 years. That is 6 months to 2 years of people having no job to return to. Plus, the vaccine will have so much demand that there will likely be significant delays in roll out, specifically to countries with low infections.

Plus there will still be lingering stigma. Even with a vaccine I don't think I'm in a hurry to go to the U.S any time soon now. No doubt the Chinese propaganda machine will be spruiking that narrative as well.

This shit happens every halving, media coverage increases, miners working together to stop selling, artificially contracting the supply, price starts going up and then the vicious fomo cycle begins with media reporting price increases + halving + punters piling in all at once, rinse/repeat.

Should still be up medium term, but I expect a solid pullback soon enough. These miners need to pay their bills and you can clearly see they aren't selling like they usually do.

Zip has to undercut APT significantly on merchant fees (online sites say around 2% for Zip compared to 4-6% with APT). Even talking to people, APT's recognition amongst the public is far higher than Zip.

It has basic level options and whatnot. I think they milk you a bit on the spreads (how they make money). I would start of off with them."	Balland-Cocgoblir	0

A simple example would be xyz call, bid 1$ - offer $2. If you want to buy, set a limit of 1.30 (or $1.01 if you have all day). Give it 5 minutes, increase to $1.35 etc. They only have to set prices on a certain number of strikes per expiry (either side of the current price), so if you want to buy way OTM you can set your own, but they don't have to react.

2020-05-06	18:37:19	"for those too stupid to bypass the paywall:

Should we blame Warren Buffett?

There’s a piece of folksy wisdom from the Oracle of Omaha for just about every situation, but many of them have at their heart a simple piece of advice: swim against the tide.

You know them all. Buy straws in winter. The market transfers wealth from the impatient to the patient. Or the ultimate motto of the contrarian investor: “Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy only when others are fearful.”

Australia’s mum and dad investors have clearly heeded Buffett’s advice, according to [a new report by the corporate watchdog,](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p54q9t) which examines trends in trading by retail investors during the early phase of the pandemic crisis, when markets were in freefall.

According to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission paper released on Wednesday, Australian retail investors traded more money, more frequently, as they tried to take profit from the market turmoil.

But there was one problem – these mini [Gordon Gekkos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVxYOQS6ggk) just weren’t very good at trading. And that’s got the watchdog worried.

The ASIC study looked at the period February 24 to April 3, during which the ASX 200 tumbled from 7,139 points to a low of 4546 points on March 23 before recovering to close at 5068.

It then compared the action from retail investors to a six month benchmark period before that, running from August 22, 2019, to February 21.

The differences between the two periods are staggering. In the benchmark period, average daily share trading by retail brokers was $1.6 billion. In the focus period of the market turmoil, that rose to $3.3 billion.

>**ASIC argues the average retail investor was pretty crummy at reading the market volatility.**

This was, of course, a hugely busy period across the entire market, with average daily turnover rising from $15 billion to $28 billion; [the jump even forced the ASX to put a cap on trading activity](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p54ih6). Still, retail trading as a proportion of all trading rose from 10.6 per cent to 11.9 per cent during the period in focus.

A good proportion of this trade wasn’t from experienced retail investors – a staggering 4,675 new investor identifiers appeared on ASIC’s radar per day on average during the 40 days of the focus period, with 140,241 new identifiers in total. New accounts made up 21.4per cent of all active accounts.

To put that in context, the previous six months has seen 1,369 new identifiers per day and an average of 34,502 over a comparable 40 day period.

On top of this, punters who’d been out of the market picked this moment to come back in. ASIC saw 142,022 accounts that didn’t trade in the benchmark period suddenly come back to life during the turmoil; these accounted for 21.6 per cent of all active accounts.

ASIC argues that the average retail investor was pretty crummy at reading the market volatility, with its report showing that on more than two thirds of the days on which retail investors were net buyers, the share prices of the stocks they invested in declined the next day.

And on the other side of the coin, on more than half of the days on which retail investors were net sellers, they watched the stock prices of investments rise the following day.

## Tinkering with alarming frequency

I’d argue that this assessment is actually pretty unhelpful – no investor worth their salt would give two hoots where a share price heads over the course of a day, or even a week.

It’s also worth noting that even if some stocks did have a short-term reaction that was contrary to the investor’s hopes, the market has bounced back pretty impressively from that low on March 23, [with the ASX 200 now up 18 per cent](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p54q78). Buying and holding would have been a pretty reasonable strategy.

Unfortunately, that’s not what retail investors did during the focus period. They appeared to have tinkered with both the portfolios and their individual holdings with alarming frequency.

During the benchmark period before the crisis, the average time between trades by the same investor in a particular stock was 4.5 days. During the focus period covering the crisis that number fell to one day.

Similarly, the average time between trades by the same investor decreased from 2.5 days to 0.9 days.

The ASIC report makes several excellent points about the added dangers of more exotic instruments, including geared exchange-traded products, oil-linked securities, listed investment companies that have seen their discounts to net tangible assets blow out, and, of course, CFDs.

The leverage involved in CFDs obviously magnifies the risks during periods of crisis. But this doesn’t appear to have been much of a deterrent, with activity in this market seen doubling from the start of the year to the middle weeks of March, when the market was falling fastest.

In the week between March 16 and March 22, based on a sample of 12 Australian licensed CFD providers with a total market share of 84 per cent, retail clients lost just over $428 million on a gross basis, and $234 million on a net basis.

## ASIC's timely warning too late for some

ASIC needs to be commended for two aspects of this report.

First, the speed with which it has been pulled together suggests a welcome sense of urgency at the corporate cop.

Secondly, ASIC has opened a valuable little window into the world of these retail investors that many wouldn’t have been aware of. The numbers around the size and frequency of trading during the crisis period are of course surprising, but so too is the data on the frequency of trading during a “normal” period, which underscores just how often the average retail investor is playing around with their portfolio.

The corporate regulator is right to emphasise how difficult it is to time the market, and especially during times of extreme volatility. Yes, bargains can be found, but patience is required.

It’s funny how investors remember some “Buffettisms” but forget others. Perhaps ASIC should have included this one on the front page of your report: “Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing.”"	rhythm34	0
2020-05-06	19:27:19	"Have seen similar stories from the USA / RobinHood account numbers. You can read this multiple ways.

1) people just thought: prices low - ignore fundamentals - buy now!

2) the equity bubble kept these people out all last year and this was their entry to the market

3) fuck it, HISA sucks, lets gamble.

4) combination of all of the above

Assuming they are all dumb is a mistake."	maximiseYourChill	0

I have not used Tastyworks in the US, you might need to do an extra step - opening a USD denominated acct with your bank first to have the 3rd party wire the USD, before transferring that on to Tastyworks.

To answer your q's

You generally dont need to worry about withholding tax. Its mostly when you get dividends and capital returns in the US. 

You can generally add your trading p/l to your income if you're an active trader - Depending on how often you trade. 

At worst you can carry forward your capital loss to offset future years profits.

I've been thinking about this wrong.  I've been thinking APT is crap cause it sucks for consumers.  But it seems users of APT are pretty dumb on average.  Turns out a reasonable percentage of them are paying the $10 late fee!  Probably too late to re-evaluate my position on APT though.

Imagine paying $17 for being a week + 1 day late on a $100 purchase; and with credit card paying \~39 cents."	maximiseYourChill	0
2020-05-06	19:53:11	Yeah and that’s one repayment too, but with credit cards do consumers pay it off within a month? Or more likely to max out the credit card and pay minimum pays. Plus late repayments on credit cards can be $20.	spookysadghoul	0

Not even going into the debate on whether the market will test new lows, but BBOZ product is based on the derivatives market's. 


Let me try explain so your smoothbrain can understand. These markets are correlated (but not perfectly) with equity markets. But with derivatives market's you also have a bunch of other variables that impact pricing eg volatility and time. Lower volatility and longer time will fuck BBOZ and even if new lows are tested.

The magnitude of how severe it is will depend on disease countermeasures we put in place. My guess is that it will not be nearly as bad, but It may still lead to another lock down, which will undoubtably stress the economy further.  


Recent case reports have identified silent asymptomatic carriers in a good proportion of the exposed population. Unless we test everyone in the country we will keep seeing recurrent waves cropping up. Closed borders makes no difference in CB transmissions.  


The majority of the AUS population lives in major urban centres where it is incredibly likely to transmit the virus. We mightn't live in sprawling megacities like NYC but the majority of the pop still live in large continental cities.   


How could you possibly justify the statement that market confidence is back? We have seen similar bluff rallies after major drops in every documented economic recession. The difference with this downturn is that the damage dealt is several orders of magnitude greater than any previous. This is not a time to be optimistic, but realistic."		0

Ok so for example I have 10,000 for trading

If I buy 20,000 worth of shares and sell them the same or next day for a profit or loss am I doing anything illegal or wrong?

Is the only risk is that I don’t have 20,000 in the case the stock drops 100% in 1 day? Which would be unlikely Or get stuck in a trading halt."	Smokeintheair37	0

2020-05-06	06:40:16	It's not illegal, it technically is a margin loan of 10000 for a period until the settlement. The downside risk is if you've lost all the 10000 then you will need to settle it. If not, the trading platform will constantly press for settlement through liquidating any available assets you have (i.e.: the remaining 10000 you have). If that doesn't happen then you will be served a notice to find a means of settlement and may then have possible repercussions.	peanuts420blaze	0

Mega infrastructure projects are never a money maker, aside from establishing a foothold in a new market, they are just a way and means to provide work for thousands of staff/wages and plants, and steady cash flow. 
I think last time LLE made money off an infrastructure job was long time ago. We bought most jobs we worked on. 

PM n engineers just get sacked. It’s not hard to do at all. 

Plus, Infrastructure was never LL specialty. They took a gamble post GFC and bought abi and bauldie but it didn’t pay off. They are going back to what they are good at. - buildings

2020-05-04	19:06:05	"Personally I think BBOZ is the better option.

Not only because the US stock market is more diversified and resilient than the ASX, but also because you have the ability to react dynamically with BBOZ as it's geared against a real index rather than a futures index. BBUS experiences the highest changes overnight due to how futures are generally linked with the real index they're based on.
I can't tell you the number of times there has been news overnight that has impacted the price of BBUS and I've been powerless to respond. If I hear news that means the market will jump, I want to get the fuck out ASAP with a geared fund. Even if it drops back, beta slippage means the fund will lose money anyway.

BBUS is much cheaper so, with the same amount of money, you can make larger gains with comparatively smaller price increases. But they're both geared against indexes so at the end of the day, 5% is 5% for the same dollar value.

Also, minor thing, Americans are absolutely retarded and have the most confusing reactions to market news. When Morrison downplayed the significance of this virus, our markets reacted negatively because...no shit, it's worrying when the government doesn't respond properly to a crisis. When Trump downplayed the pandemic, their markets soared. I don't understand their judgement or mentality well enough to predict how they'll respond to news, so I'm a lot more cautious."	Pro_Extent	0
2020-05-04	19:33:53	"BEAR.. Avoid the leverage decay. 

&#x200B;

As there is no BEAR equivalent for the US market you can achieve a similar effect by owning 60% BBUS and 40% IVV as a hedge to approximate a 1:1 inverse on daily gains/falls. This is what I am doing personally as I think the US market has further to fall."	FoxBox1988	0

* Oil prices are low, but nowhere near as low when the market plunged.

* Markets have priced in the effects of QE and government bailouts.

* Economies are even in the process of opening up.

It's all there but people are still selling. The market finally figured out that this isn't short term and the economy is fucked."	Pro_Extent	0

2020-05-04	06:07:53	I was thinking about this too as there is no US market equivalent of BEAR. My rough calculations show that holding about 60% BBUS and 40% IVV will give approximately a 1:1 inverse for the SPX overall. Won't be perfect due to the ETFs not tracking perfectly and currency differences but close. Might be a better strategy if you expect a slower grind lower.	FoxBox1988	0
2020-05-04	05:06:31	"Autist but I don't know how easy it would be to tell because from what I understand the decay comes from how volatile up and down it is as it drops.  If the XJO went down 0.1% every day for the year and never had a positive day, I don't think there'd be any decay and the returns would be the same as if the XJO went -30% in a day.

I guess you could just look at how GEAR has performed compared to the XJO over a similar timeframe in a bull market to see how much decay ate into the return.  Maybe bear markets are more volatile so BBOZ would decay more in the inversed situation?"	Nugget-Ned	0
2020-05-04	15:25:42	"Have a look at the historical prices to see the effect.  I think it would still be worth holding in a prolonged downturn, but of course you won't see the exact 2.7x returns.

2020-05-05	00:08:48	"The decay effect arises due to the mathematical fact that a percentage loss requires a larger percentage gain to get back to even. This is true of everything, the leverage just amplifies the effect. 

For example a 20% loss requires a 25% gain to get back to even. 

A 50% loss requires a 100% gain to get back to even.. 

The leverage just amplifies and makes it harder to get back if you're down.

Im not sure, but technically I think it would be better for BBOZ if the market was up 5 days in a row and down 5 days in a row, then if it up-down-up-down."	DayyyTripper	0

The options are generally written by MM companies. You can view who writes what at asx.com.au (on phone, too lazy to link). They also set the prices. 

The spreads are wide because volume, and because they can be (google ""ASX ETO Market Maker Scheme""). MMs are ""incentivised"" to meet minimum options quoting requirements like spread, number of strikes, number of expiries. They don't particularly care if they're good value.

From my experience, options are almost never exercised. You buy from a MM, then sell back to them at a profit or loss, and then they expire. 

You could buy NAB shares and sell covered calls at whatever price you like, provided you have a level 2 options account. Whether anyone buys them is another matter."	Ratty-fish	0

2020-05-02	14:01:37	"Can't see the ASX trading much higher from a technical or valuation perspective. 

From a technical view, XJO has run out of puff a few times around 5500 and gone to retest 5200. We're still range bound in that area, however with banking and healthcare stocks still trading at relatively high values in comparison to global peers.

Valuation wise, CBA still trading at a PE of 13.5x when it's earning are about to get crushed for the next 6-12 months (potentially years). US banks are trading under 10x. Low interest rates don't help bank profits. COH and CSL are still trading on PEs of 88x and 48x respectively, historically this has trended around 30x. Markets are still 30-40% overvalued in my view. The counter argument is that our cash is worth bugger all but once divis evaporate the alternative sounds better. 

There is no blood on the streets yet, I remember the GFC well. Some co workers postponed retirement for 5 years because their super was decimated. I want to see everyone telling me not to buy shares because they are a waste of money. When the last bull has fallen that's when it's time to buy. The reason I don't think the last low of 4400 was the bottom is because volumes were too high, I want a low volume test showing that bulls can't see ""value"" anymore.

The big elephant in the room is our housing bubble which has reinflated to ridiculous levels. With immigration pretty much stopped for the time being it's going to be interesting how valuations are maintained. Most market commentators seem to think there will be a 10% correction but I think that may be too conservative. I'd think a minimum of 20% should be base case with a 50/50 chance of 30% if we don't have a workable solution to this virus by the end of the year.

Make no mistake, this is going to change everyone's habits post COVID, the market has not yet priced this in.

Apologies for this wall of text, got a bit carried away.

TLDR : XJO is currently range bound, but I am fairly confident that it will retest lows at some point this year."	daclaw2k	0

STO CEO sold 2.2m of shares in earl April - and with current Oil glut I'd be wary of short term outlook.

QAN - Gut feel some retrace will occur when rumours/ news of Virgin coming back as stronger competition, also wary of short term outlook

2020-05-02	19:42:20	Brilliant. Thanks for that. I’ll keep those in mind for Monday. At the moment I’m looking at a small loss at worst so happy to wear that for my peace of mind. If we’re heading into the crash some are now predicting, I guess there’ll be the opportunity to purchase cheaper down the track.	manorto	0

Looks like you're buying OOO, which at this moment isn't utterly insane actually given they may avoid another contango squeeze (maybe). Though the data on Cushing storage does look a bit like a max out to me.

I will say though that this does look rather suspiciously like pumping or insider trading. We don't want to be policing pumpers or insider trading. We also don't want ASIC popping up and investigating/causing trouble in our real lives.

I haven't had a chance to look too much at the leach results, though I actually am probably one of the rare people here who could understand them given a former life in a met lab running gold bottle rolls.

 It's much more profitable to look down the list of 200 companies and pick the 5 you'd expect to drop the most and then short them specifically. It's still a good diversification. The odds of you being wrong 5/5 companies if the market does broadly go down is pretty damn small. The problem with BBOZ is a (say) 4.5% gain really isn't going to rocket up the portfolio much.

Plenty more are going to be big losers in the coming drop.

All that said, this is just what people are thinking and buying because of it. There is no understanding the massive hit they are taking which will kill profits for years. I'm thinking the best time to buy BBOZ is when things open up and people think things are good. Before reality hits home for everyone.	freeononeday	0

2020-05-01	04:32:18	The market is currently quite resilient to short-term bad news (paradoxically). In the absence of really bad news, the market is slowly (naturally) going to start cooling off and then it will drop off when the realities of austerity and unending debt kick in. Markets drop when confidence drops. Some predict a week from now, others predict August based on previous trends. I cannot speculate. I play it day-by-day. Best of luck out there.		0
2020-05-01	02:09:04	Qantas has me baffled too. It was trading at $1.95 a couple of years ago. Surely things are worse now. Virgin may be bought out and continue to compete. On the plus side the lower oil price will make it less difficult to make a margin.

If you are after a pretty interface then you can just use Commsec for your live feeds and equity research reports (which is what i do) but in terms of actual trade execution I use Self Wealth because its far cheaper

Also if you sign up with a referral link you get 5 FREE trades. So nothing to lose if you want to give 5 free day trades a shot? This is my referral link if you want to use:

The level of QE we are seeing in the US today is completely unprecedented and the potential long term damage is large, but short term (months not days) it seems like their unashamed willingness to ***BRRRRRRRRRRRRRR*** is providing a lot of confidence that companies will not go under - and therefore will all *eventually* recover to ATH and beyond.

What makes Akida technology so different from first- and second-generation neural processors?  By integrating all the required elements into a consolidated, small-footprint, purpose-built neural processor, the Akida processor eliminates unnecessary compute and data I/O overhead and eliminates the excess power consumption caused by interaction and communication between separate elements.

Unlike legacy processors, the Akida processor is event-based. “Events” indicate the presence of useful information. Conventional technologies process all information without discerning if it is useful, wasting effort and resources.  In addition, as an event-based processor, it is capable of learning without re-training”

“The Akida neural processor analyzes data such as images, sounds, data patterns, and other sensor data and extracts useful information generated from events in the data. Events tend to be sparse, and as in the human brain, this sparsity contributes to significant power savings by eliminating wasted effort executing computations on data with no value. In combination with state-of-the-art circuit architecture and implementation, the Akida neural processor reduces power consumption by up to 10x over the most power-efficient alternatives on the market and up to 1,000x compared with standard data center architectures.

The way I see it is...

BBOZ is inversely correlated to ASX200 futures.

Nearly 60% of the ASX200 is made up by healthcare, financial (banks) and materials (resources).

Commodity prices haven't been hit much by covid (except for oil) even though demand has fallen through the floor.

I feel that there is some FOMO buying going on at the moment, lots of new investors coming on board trying to buy up.

I think that while positive, the Consumer Price Index (which is what inflation is based on) might not be a great indicator of future inflation. This is because CPI tracks prices of different 'bundles' of goods, to determine price movement. As you can see here, CPI got *boosted* by vegetables (probably from profiteering off panic buying).

2020-04-29	15:52:27	Don't know about CCP but usually for a CR you get a letter in the mail via whoever manages their share registry (Link Market or Computershare usually) and you fill it in and send it back.	simonline-au	0
2020-04-29	20:05:59	"If you're on the registry at the cut-off date (looks like 8/5/20) you'll get a letter and/or email about the offer. There will be a form to fill in, enter your HIN and they match you with your holding. You get to select a 'parcel' of shares you want to apply for, usually in $2,500 increments, to a max of $30k in this case. You pay by bpay directly upfront and there are no broker fees.

If the $30m retail placement is oversubscribed bear in mind that as a new retail shareholder with not much skin in the game you will be at the absolute bottom of the list. You could get nothing. Whatever part of your bpay transfer doesn't get taken up gets returned to you (without interest of course).  Honestly I wouldn't expect anything from it so don't get your hopes up of some quick profit.

CR not generally known for favouring retail investors over institutions. Recent article about COH might be of interest: [https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/04/24/collear-board-question/](https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/04/24/collear-board-question/)"	rhythm34	0
2020-04-29	20:29:54	Usually you just do the Bpay. The Bpay code lets them automagically allocate the shares to you. If the price is heavily discounted you can often sell them straight into the market at a profit. Although sometimes everyone else tries to do the same and the profit vanishes.	NonUser73	0

2020-04-29	12:08:54	Are you in the green overall with CFD's or just another statistic ? :)	maximiseYourChill	0
2020-05-01	05:10:04	"Def statistic haha. It's fucked because so often I know exactly how the charts will move but I'll pussy out, then eventually I'll go fuck it YOLO and I get wiped out. But I am getting better slowly, and have been betting relatively smaller amounts to try to figure out a strategy.

What I've learned is to:

\- Only do long plays (by that I really should say an hours to days. Betting on minute movements is like rolling dice)

\- Set the stop loss further than you think you need to, outside of the long-ish term trading channel, and adjust your multiplier based on what you're comfortable losing, not what you want to win.

\- Have extra money in your account so they don't close out your positions (they did this for an oil CFD I had which I placed at around $20 with a Take Profit at $12... ffs, I still had money but it got to their arbitrary ""too low"" point and closed it, I would have made ten's of thousands if they didn't do that).

\- And last is to ONLY play in the direction of the market. If the market is in a bull trend, only do buys, for bear trends, only do sells. That way even if it starts going down, as long as you've placed your stop loss outside the trading range, it'll eventually go back up again.

Pretty good success rate with this, I just have to get over my emotions because I keep cancelling them early."	3thaddict	0
2020-05-01	15:25:22	"I'm a statistic so far.  In almost all cases I have gotten the overall trend right but didn't allow enough for my stops (similar your to your 2nd point), or was not patient enough (closed early because after 10 days it wasn't deeply green, but at 20 days would have made profit).

CFD's are not that profitable when your stops are at the mercy of whimsical movements of the market over a few days, even though your long term view is correct, cause your stops have to be so large the leverage effect is lessened dramatically.

I see CFD as a tool for when you have extremely high conviction on the movements.  Not a tool to be regularly used.  So I will keep my account open and only ever use it extreme cases."	maximiseYourChill	0
2020-05-06	00:06:29	"Yeah that's exactly what I've noticed. I was forgetting to account for shorter term movements when going long. I've changed that now and that eliminated most of my remaining fails. (I still have the pussy problem though. I was SURE XJO would go straight to 5400 today but didn't place the bet. And the day before I cancelled THREE positions early which would have been MUCH MORE profitable. ugh...)

Yep you have to balance leverage based on stop loss. And I only do a trade if loss is far smaller than gain, which makes it a bit more complicated too.

2020-04-29	03:49:01	"1. My first investment was 2k into crypto in 2017 (before the bubble) and I managed it into 100k by the end of the year. For shares though, I would try to avoid paying more than 1% in brokerage so go 1k+.  
  
2. Over diversified means spread too thin. It's easier to pick 5 winners than 500. You always have to consider brokerage and whether it's worth owning little amounts of shares. Under diversified means you're overexposed to a something, so for example owning 4 shares and they're all banks. IMHO best to just go with index funds like Vanguard.  

3. Results speak for themselves. If you accept the premise that you cannot predict the market and that markets go up in the long term then DCA is the best strategy. If you always wait for a good opportunity you may miss a lot of gainz.  
  
4. Don't catch a falling knife. Have a buy strategy and stick to it.  
  
5. Good question. I ask myself that all the time. I guess it may help you sleep better at night.knowing your money is smartly invested and not relying on greater-fool-theory or fraud.  
  
6. I don't. I ride the waves. When im down (especially with my crypto) I feel like shit. When I'm up I feel great though. A few years ago I sold some crypto that a month latter ended up 10x and I lost out on about 300k AUD. It devastated me but I coped by convincing myself that you don't need fancy cars or a nice postcodes to be happy. As Seneca says,

&#x200B;

If $500 is what you've got to make a stupid decision. Then that's how much you can blow. I spent my first 2-3 yrs of options buying buying $500 at a time. I learnt a lot on how it all works. It still hurt to know the money I'd made had evaporated, but it was very informative.

&#x200B;

Diversification is for /r/Ausfinance. Here we go for the dumbest possible focus. We had a guy throw all his money at OOO.

&#x200B;

Dollar cost averaging is for people who think the market will in the long term rise. Here people think it will rise in the super short term due to Brrr.

&#x200B;

You buy a good stock until it's no longer good. That's something you usually realise when it's 90% down.

&#x200B;

Due dilligence is basically as good as you can do. Don't worry, it's also the central banks which cook the books, the business fraud is childs play in comparison. These are people who are inflating away entire generations chances of a safe and secure life.

&#x200B;

The market can't separate itself from it's emotions, why shouldn't you? I trusted my gut in Late feb and it make me loads of money. Of course I then I didn't get a gut feeling to change my direction and then lost most of the gains in April. My gut then said that 2 weeks ago was the dead cat top. For SPY that's looking like some bullshit gut feelings and for XJO probably within a day or two."	_TheLordOfRuin_	0
2020-04-29	12:44:14	If you want to dip your toe in, try commsec pocket. Buy some IOZ on there. I do recommend r/Ausfinance for discussions about that. Returns will likely be garbage though, heading into a recession and all.	Ratty-fish	0
2020-04-29	06:01:49	"As this is effectively a gambling sub, ill answer as if your asking to go to a casino

1. I wouldn’t consider there to be a minimum amount to gamble, set yourself a limit of what you’re willing to lose, because it’s very likely you will lose it. Of course it’s worth considering brokerage. If you have to pay the dealer a tip for every hand you play then you may want to up the buy in to offset that cost

2. No such thing as over diversified as far as I’m concerned, but definitely watch out for under diversification. If you’re having no luck at roulette you should leave the table and go play blackjack or poker. Don’t put all your money on the favourite horse in a single race

3. I never really considered dollar cost averaging tbh but in reality it’s likely a good thing. If you’re playing blackjack and you get two 7’s you always split your hand.

4. If you’re doubling down you need to be careful. As my man Kenny Rodgers says you gotta know when to hold em, know when to fold em, and know when to walk away. Watch out for bubbles (for example, the media hype bubble that plagued bitcoin in 2018) and otherwise you just have to research and guess the high and low. No one knows for sure when they should double down, the whole exercise is an educated guess

5. The whole risk of gambling is that the house always wins. A lot of companies have become too big to fail, and will inevitably cook their books or be bailed out. The whole gamble can go tits up for no reason whatsoever. Even on a safe bet, the house has better odds, for example in roulette people think if they bet on black or red they have a 50/50 chance to win, but realistically there’s a green 0 that will void your win and the odds are more like 49.5/50.5. Books get cooked in an air fryer and the house always wins unless you’re lucky enough to know when to walk away

6. It’s hard to seperate emotion from money. I find that only gambling with what you can afford to lose is the best way to go. Obviously you don’t want to lose the money but it’s a risk you have to accept in order to have your fun and potentially make your gains. It’s a lot easier if you can afford a home with running water and food after your more catastrophic losses"	FallenSegull	0

2020-04-28	19:56:05	I think it will take 6 months before you start to see the real impact... what we have seen was everything fall off a cliff. But the government stepped in and stopped it all from collapsing... job keeper/seeker can only last so long. The government can’t keep ploughing money into those schemes forever... banks have given people repayment holidays for 6 months again that won’t last for ever. The recovery for economic activity to go back to first half of FY21 is probably 2+ years away... until the government cuts back on its bail outs and banks start pressuring customers around Ioan payments you probably won’t see a whole lot of panic... yesterday NAB had a statement around loan deferrals. 70,000 customers of just NAB have asked for reprieve. Expand that across all the big 4 banks. Plus the tier twos and other lenders and credit uninios. You could have close to 1,000,000 people who without support wouldn’t be able to keep on top of bills... the only reason you’re not seeing a 2008 US style mass exodus from property is the government support... the $20k super scheme will dry up eventually to....

2020-04-28	22:41:25	"The Big 4 sell their mortgages as RMBS. CBA at least have a fairly decent excel sheet that they release monthly which shows arrears (they are called medallion from memory). Though the numbers aren't really that useful, since they aren't the people who will see mortgage stress first.
 
 
 
Pepper finance and similar non prime finance and mortgage lenders is probably the real source you want. But they keep their data locked up and you need an account. Most likely, if you got an account and were using it to harvest data on mortgage stress and then released it, that would be a terms violation."	_TheLordOfRuin_	0

By reducing dividends is one way of shoring up a banks capital position because less is paid out back to shareholders. This can also be achieved by inviting more shareholders to purchase equity (I.e. A capital raise) 

As loan losses and bad debts increase, so does the amount of capital required as the ""buffer"" is reduced."	jams100	0

2020-04-27	20:35:46	"That depends on the broker, and I've never exercised. In theory you could exercise, but that's not what most people on here and WSB want to do. We're just selling them on to someone else (possibly a MM) once the price has gone up. I'll give you an example:

As mentioned, earlier today I bought 10 x WBC $16c 16/7 calls for $0.6 (per share, so $60 per contract - $640 total with brokerage).

Even though these are still quite far out of the money  - WBC is trading at $14.85 - they are now closer then when I bought them (WBC was $14.45). I could now sell these for $0.68 - 9% profit.

However, there is still 80 days to expiry. Provided it continues to move up, and I don't hold too long I should be able to sell at a much better price. If the price goes back up to $17 in the next 50 days I should be able to sell for 3-400% what I paid.

Alternatively WBC stays where it is, or goes down, and I lose everything."	Ratty-fish	0

2020-04-27	02:31:31	That's the problem. Options get more expensive as you go further out. Investing might not work that way but trading on a view does. If profits and sentiment don't dip for a year, options will  take that long to pay out. The market doesn't accurately price in information, it's dumb as dogshit at it.	letsburn00	0
2020-04-27	02:51:16	Yea fair point re options.. In Australia especially being anti real estate is considered about as bad as burning the flag.. I think it'll be a slow wind down for residential property over the next 24 months at least. Not because it's any less screwed but just because for at least a year, a lot of people will be leading with emotion over logic. For commercial though it'll probably react faster since there's less emotion in commercial real estate. My (uneducated) guess is that prices will crash 25% within 12 months from pre corona levels.	warthogdog	0

2020-04-27	16:30:56	Very true regarding the political elite. The question will be what they can actually do to stop it this time. The idea they will debase the currency with QE might have held water in 2008, but this time around if they aren't terrified of Bitcoin they should be. It's on a bit of a tear now and a lot of people will lose faith in fiat currency if they don't believe the debts will ever be repaid.	warthogdog	0

2020-04-27	22:51:01	Fair point, but the market isn't reflecting economic reality even 3 months from now. Usually, economic downturns are usually accompanied by a huge stock market decline (e.g. the GFC, the Great Depression). We face an economic crisis worse than the GFC and we get a quick 30% drop and then a V-shaped recovery back up - seems pretty odd.	malbro08	0

International students and workers won't be coming back anytime soon.

And this is not to mention businesses potentially being unable to pay off short term debts, spreading to the banks and causing a debt crisis.

Logically, the outflows actually will be fairly substantial vs the normal turnover on the ASX. Though compared to market cap it's nothing. But in the end, futures dominate ASX operations on most days. If the RBA is in fact buying equities or futures, if would effectively be the government supporting prices while these transactions happen.

2020-04-28	13:03:01	This is very wrong. Generally the people more inclined to be taking the money out are more inclined to be in high growth funds that are disproportionately heavy in equities. The funds can't just take cash from people in lower risk funds to make up cash needed for higher risk funds even if the cash is technically on their books. The only way to meet high risk fund withdrawals is to make up the cash from within that customer group.	warthogdog	0

2020-04-23	18:48:22	Considering most of the money in the asx is in equities owned by those super funds, I consider it highly unlikely this is already 'priced in'. It will only be fully 'priced in' when those assets are fully liquidated.	warthogdog	0

2020-04-23	20:30:28	"This is unfortunately very wrong. The numbers you quote are correct. However:

> tldr; Impact will vary from 0% to absolute maximum 2%.

This is incorrect. Price discovery for any asset is based on total supply vs total *demand* at any given time. 

The example you gave above is equating the total supply (withdrawals of 50b) with the size of the asx, not the demand that will be available to purchase the supply. The size of the asx is in no way representative of the demand for purchasing more assets that we would expect to see. 

Asset prices are often very sensitive to supply and demand for this reason. It's why the housing market will tumble in prices despite being worth a bomb if there are far more sellers than buyers."	warthogdog	0

2020-04-23	23:10:34	Remember though. When you sign up for a fund, they generally will set you to X% stocks, Y% bonds etc. Going into cash means they need to liquidate roughly equivilant tothis breakdown. They can't just get all the 10% of cash everyone has and make their stocks go from 80% to 88% because their percentage in cash has gone to 0% because other people took it all.	_TheLordOfRuin_	0

2020-04-24	00:23:41	They're not required to liquidate an equivalent of the break down, they're just required to fork out an equivalent in cash, the rest can be handled by shuffling numbers around. These funds maintain large buffers for situations like these and have got the RBA backing them up, ultimately the super funds are going to avoid liquidating assets that cause further depreciation of the assets they own, which is why it's difficult to see super withdrawals having a meaningful effect on the market in that way.

2020-04-22	22:36:06	"Yeah this looks about the situation to me. I think the key is to stick to a strategy. I see so many people pick a line and then when it gets a little scary they jump ship (normally getting the worst of both sides).
Which of these scenarios are you more leaning towards?
Personally, I'm a bear for short to medium term and then once I see another big drop and the world is one big gay bear orgy I will start going long as a bull again. Maybe even get on the GEAR for some of the recovery.
If we have already seen the bottom then... Fuck."	tatey13	0

2020-04-22	23:30:23	"The economy is broken as fuck and there's no way the economy will see a V shaped rise in the short-medium term, so I think the market should crash on this basis.

The problem is, I just don't see where the incentive to leave the market is for shareholders. Where are they going to take their money and go invest? In Australia there's going to be an oversupply in property, cash rate is 0.25% so not returns to be made there. Buying up distressed assets? Unless there's a couple major casualties in the UK/US and some margins get called, I can't see a big decline happening. I absolutely think it should, but for some reason I don't think it will."

2020-04-23	00:41:34	Your worst case doesn't have to be so bad shorting in the bull scenario.  Just have a stop limit so you max lose $10k or whatever an acceptable limit is for you.   That'd be like a 25% drop in bboz ~10% rise in XJO.  You say you think another drop is coming, that gives you enough space for the XJO to rise nearly 10% before it crashes.  If it does rise above then just cash out the loss and still leaves you with 30k to throw into your more conservative bull strategy.	Nugget-Ned	0

2020-04-22	23:08:08	"My heart tells me we're going to see another 20%-50% drop within 2 months, so I am leaning towards BBOZ in the short term. I reckon we will bottom out by Q3, and recovery will take _at least_ until the end of 2021. I don't see how it's possible for the market to keep trending up at the current rate, because we would be fully recovered within a couple of months, and we're only just starting to see the stats coming out negative within the last couple of days, so the bulls have been trading blind.

I think the only nightmare scenario re going short would be getting fucked by the big green QE dildo. Maybe the government will be able to inflate asset prices so much that it neutralises the drop, in which case we could see a massive spike that would take BBOZ down to $0. I don't know how likely that is, so I need to research how QE has affected stock prices in other countries like Japan."	OverflowingSarcasm	0

2020-04-22	23:47:47	Yeah, I'm worried that people are parking their money in stocks just to hedge against possible inflation caused by QE, because there is nowhere else to put it. Something to keep in mind. Maybe I should be looking at future dividend yields vs cash rate.	OverflowingSarcasm	0
2020-04-23	00:44:53	I guess because I plan on holding VAS for the long term so I want it to be less risky. And don't all leveraged ETFs like GEAR have slippage if you hold them over the long term?	OverflowingSarcasm	0

VAS I plan to hold for a while, so it depends when I sell, how much I sell, and what my other income is that financial year."	OverflowingSarcasm	0
